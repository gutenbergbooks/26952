<p style=' font-size:1.2em;'>PREFACE.</p>
</div>

<p>The story of the travels of Eric and his
friends on the continent of Europe will, I
trust, be interesting to my young readers.
Many of the incidents described are actual
facts, and the descent of Eric, in diving armor,
to the bottom of the sea, will be found to possess
some items which will be worth remembering.</p>
<p>The sights, sounds, and sensations which I
have described, are such as any submarine diver
of experience has seen, heard, and felt, and
therefore will be instructive in a certain way.</p>
<p>The finding a box of gold by the divers is
not of often occurrence, although valuables are
reclaimed from the ocean in this manner occasionally.</p>
<p>The lesson taught by Eric&#8217;s honesty in trying
to find the owner of the money, and its
influence on his accusers, when he is unjustly
accused of theft, will be worthy of attention to
all my young friends who have a name to
make.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>LEAVING THE CASTLE.</h3>
</div>

<p>Olendorf is not far from Hamburg.
The broad and sparkling Elbe washes
it on the western side, and with the rugged
mountains and the weird grand, old forests
upon the north and east, seem to shut the
little town quite in from the outer world;
yet Olendorf had been an important place
and on account of its grand old fortress,
Castle Wernier, was a bone of contention
throughout the French and German wars;
and between the French, who were resolute
to hold the fortress, and the barons of
Wernier, who were equally resolute to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
regain it, the castle suffered severely; and
when, long years after, peace was declared,
the last baron of Wernier died, and the castle
came into the possession of Adele Stanley,
his great granddaughter, it was merely a
grand old ruin.</p>
<p>Adele&#8217;s father rebuilt the tower and a
couple of wings, and furnished all the habitable
rooms, intending to have his little Adele
and Herbert spend their childhood there.
But while Adele was yet almost a baby, her
kind father died. Then she lost her mother,
and was for a long time a wanderer among
strangers in a foreign land; and the old castle
had been uninhabited, except by Gretchen,
the gardener&#8217;s wife, and the owls in its dark
turrets. Now, however, the long windows
were thrown open to the fresh breezes and
sunshine; merry laughter rang up from the
garden; children&#8217;s voices echoed among the
ruins, and children&#8217;s feet danced through the
long corridors, keeping time to the music of
the happy voices.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>Adele and Herbert Stanley were at the
castle with their young guests from New
York&mdash;Eric and Nettie Hyde. They had
spent the summer months there; &#8220;the happiest
months in their lives,&#8221; they all declared.
Now, alas! the merry season was
drawing to a close. Adele was to go to her
grandfather&#8217;s home in England, Herbert to
school at Eton, Nettie with her mother to
New York, and Eric was to travel in Holland
and the German states with his uncle,
Dr. Ward, and his cousin, Johnny Van
Rasseulger.</p>
<p>Such a busy day as it was to be! But
just now all care was forgotten, even to the
regret at parting, in watching the absurd
freaks of little Froll, the monkey. Her real
name was Frolic; but who ever heard children
call a pet by its real name?</p>
<p>Mrs. Hyde called to Nettie, requesting her
to do an errand. At the sound of her voice
Nettie ran towards her, exclaiming,&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;O, mamma! Adele has given us such a
splendid present, to take home with us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, my dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it so dearly! It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;&mdash;here
Nettie&#8217;s voice trembled a little, and her heart
knew its own misgivings&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;s&mdash;Froll,
mamma, the little darling!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who <i>is</i> Froll, the little darling!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That dear little monkey,&#8221; answered
Nettie, pointing to Froll, now close at
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Hyde, retreating
hastily, &#8220;I dislike monkeys, and I cannot
have one travelling with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, mamma&mdash;&#8221; said Nettie, piteously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not think of it, my dear; it is
quite impossible,&#8221; was the decided reply, to
Nettie&#8217;s disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;But may not Eric take her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Charlie must decide that question:
if he has no objections to travelling with an
animal that is never out of mischief, I suppose
Eric may take charge of her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But then, mamma, Eric will be gone a
whole long year&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And as you have lived nine whole long
years,&#8221; interrupted her mother, smiling,
&#8220;without a monkey, or a desire for one,
don&#8217;t you think you could survive the separation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nettie didn&#8217;t then think she could; but
a while after, when Froll chased her with
a paint-brush dripping wet with red paint,
and then completely spoiled a pretty landscape
view that Herbert was painting for
her, she changed her mind, and decided
that a voyage from Hamburg to New York
with such an uncontrollable creature would
be, to say the least, inconvenient.</p>
<p>To be sure, papa was to meet them at the
Hague, and he might be willing to look to
her safe transportation across the Atlantic;
but she had not much faith in this argument,
and, making a virtue of necessity, resigned
herself with becoming grace to her mother&#8217;s
wishes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>Looking back upon the pleasant summer
months at Castle Wernier, the children
thought time had never gone so quickly.
They were soon to be parted from each
other, and their pleasant German home and
every object took a new interest to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The value of a thing is never known till
we have lost it,&#8221; Herbert said, sorrowfully,
thinking how lonely Adele and he would become
when parted from their companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor how dear a place an old castle is,
until we are forced to leave it,&#8221; said Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember thinking once,&#8221; said Nettie,
&#8220;that this place was horrible. It was when
we were all so frightened about the ghost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And all the time I was the ghost,&#8221;
Adele added; &#8220;and I used to think it very
hard that I couldn&#8217;t speak to you, not knowing
that I was frightening you all out of
your wits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose more than half the ghosts we
read about are only people walking in their
sleep, as Adele did,&#8221; said Herbert.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Nettie; &#8220;but if we stay
here all day, talking about ghosts, what will
become of our pets and toys?&#8221;</p>
<p>As Herbert and Adele were to start for
their home in England when Mrs. Hyde
and her children left the castle, all their pets
were to be disposed of among the gardener&#8217;s
children, that is, all but Froll, for Eric
was sure that uncle Charlie would not object
to having the little creature for a travelling
companion; and as Mrs. Hyde would not
allow Nettie to take her with her, Froll was
to make the tour of Germany with Dr.
Ward and the boys.</p>
<p>There were the pony, and the rabbits, and
the canary bird, of all which Gretchen&#8217;s
children were to take the utmost care, until
the dear <i>Fraulien</i> and the young <i>Herr</i>
should come again. And many and loud
were the expressions of affectionate regret at
the children&#8217;s departure, oddly intermingled
with exclamations of delight at the appearance
of numerous toys, which Mrs. Nichols
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
and Mrs. Hyde had decided must be left
over from the packing.</p>
<p>Then the garden must be visited in every
nook and corner. Particular directions must
be left with Hans concerning their choice
flowers and favorite plants.</p>
<p>And then there was the grand event of
the day&mdash;the packing up of their own individual
treasures, in the shape of books and
toys. They worked hard all day, and were
very proud of their work when all was accomplished;
but, in the dead of night, when
they were fast in the &#8220;Land o&#8217; Nod,&#8221; old
mauma, who was prowling around the trunks
and hampers to see if all were secure,
seemed rather suspicious of one, and knelt
down on the floor to examine it, giving it a
little shake, by way of test.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear heart alive!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;just
you look here, missis, please. All those
little flimpsy toys and things to bottom, an&#8217;
the heavy book stuck in any ways to top, an&#8217;
all of &#8217;em jolting roun&#8217; like anything!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Poor tired Mrs. Hyde could not help
smiling, as she leaned wearily over the two
hampers the children had filled, and gave
directions to mauma and Gretchen about repacking
them.</p>
<p>The two women soon accomplished what
it had taken the children all day to perform;
and to their faithful exertions was owing the
safe arrival at Fifth Avenue and Ennisfellen
of the toys.</p>
<p>Early in the morning the children were
aroused to prepare for their journey. They
were all in high spirits, and thought dressing
and breakfasting by candle-light the &#8220;greatest
fun in the world;&#8221; though it is doubtful
if they would have held to their opinion had
the practice been continued permanently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody wants breakfast so early,&#8221; Nettie
said, as she laughed and talked in excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure nobody wants to lunch on the
train,&#8221; shouted Eric, across the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;The train, indeed! Why, we shall be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
aboard the steamer at noon. I like to travel
on these European steamers,&#8221; Nettie called
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so glad we are all to travel together
to the Hague,&#8221; said Adele&#8217;s sweet
voice. &#8220;How quickly you dress, Nettie!
But where <i>can</i> my other boot be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know; let&#8217;s look for it.
Here &#8217;tis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough; and I&#8217;ve been all this time
doing up yours. Shouldn&#8217;t wonder if we did
miss the train. And it&#8217;s in a knot, and I can&#8217;t
untie it. Mauma, mauma, bring another
light here, quick! and you&#8217;d better hurry,
Adele.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nettie, did you mean the train was in a
knot?&#8221; called Herbert.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s <i>not</i>,&#8221; said Nettie, quickly; and
then they all laughed merrily. For, though
Nettie&#8217;s remark was not particularly brilliant,
there was enough in it to amuse the happy,
excited hearts around her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>The breakfast received a very slight share
of attention. The boys were constantly running
below to &#8220;see after the horses,&#8221; and
Nettie was dancing about, in everybody&#8217;s
way, assuring them all that they would certainly
lose the train, and begging Adele, for
her own safety, to keep close to her, and not
to be nervous on any account.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know somebody will forget something!&#8221;
she exclaimed for the fiftieth time.
&#8220;Be sure, all of you, to remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to forget,&#8221; interrupted Eric, mischievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;The carriage has come to the door, Herr
Von Nichols!&#8221; Gretchen announced, through
her tears.</p>
<p>All the Werniers, the ancient holders of
the castle, had been Herr Vons; and as Mrs.
Nichols was a Wernier, Gretchen had adopted
the villagers&#8217; fashion of bestowing the title
upon the husband.</p>
<p>The servants were in the hall, sorrowfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
awaiting the departure of their kind
patrons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good by! Good by!&#8221; the children
shouted; while the mournful group bade
them &#8220;God speed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s forgotten anything?&#8221; said Nettie,
crowding into a corner of the carriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you have, my dear,&#8221; answered
her mother. &#8220;Where is your sacque?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nettie looked quite dismayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, I packed it, mamma. I forgot I was
to wear this dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a general consternation at this
confession, until mauma drew the missing
article from under her shawl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here &#8217;tis, Miss Nettie. I &#8217;spects you&#8217;d
want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ever so much obliged to you, mauma,&#8221;
said Nettie, eagerly seizing the sacque,
and putting herself into it, while Mrs. Hyde
rewarded the faithful old colored woman
with a grateful smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was so busy remembering for the
others, mamma,&#8221; Nettie said, apologetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it would be as well for you to
attend more particularly to yourself, my
dear,&#8221; was her mother&#8217;s mild rebuke.</p>
<p>Mr. Nichols and the boys were busy
stowing boxes and parcels in various hidden
compartments of the carriage. Just as Mr.
Nichols announced that they were ready to
start, Eric thrust his head in at the door,
exclaiming, funnily,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, Nettie is so anxious, suppose
you all just feel inside your bonnets, to make
sure that your heads are here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t detain us, Eric,&#8221; his mother said,
smiling at the frank, joyous face.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, mamma. This is my load:
let me see,&mdash;Mrs. Hyde, Adele, Nettie,
and mauma. Go ahead, Carl.&#8221;</p>
<p>The coachman drew up his reins, and the
spirited horses, after curvetting and prancing
for an instant, dashed down the avenue,
Adele&#8217;s and Nettie&#8217;s white handkerchiefs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
floating on the breeze, in a last adieu to
Wernier.</p>
<p>They were followed immediately by another
carriage, containing Mr. and Mrs.
Nichols and the boys; and, except for the
group of sorrowing servants, watching the
fast-disappearing carriages, Castle Wernier
was left alone.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Aboard of the Hague, the children,
watching the distant spires and domes
of Hamburg &#8220;melt into air&#8221; as the vessel bore,
with almost imperceptible motion rapidly towards
the North Sea, began to realize that
they would see no more of Wernier. And
though their sorrow but faintly came home
to them, they were sad and thoughtful.</p>
<p>Adele whispered mournfully to Herbert,
&#8220;O, let us go below! It is so like going
out in the Europa, with dear mamma, before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
she died in the wreck. O, Herbie, I cannot
bear the cruel, cruel sea. Take me
below.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Herbert and Adele went to the cabin,
and Eric suggested to Nettie that they should
follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nettie, &#8220;I like to stay here.
Eric, see that boy look at you; I think he
wants to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric looked around, and saw a boy of his
own age steadfastly regarding him. When
he caught Eric&#8217;s eye, he bowed and hastened
forward, holding out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eric Hyde?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Eric. &#8220;Do you know me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never <i>saw</i> you before; but I know
you, for all that,&#8221; said the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; said Eric, astonished, and interested,
too.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you by your voice. I used to
live next door to you in New York. I was
blind then, and auntie sent me out to Hamburg,
to the famous oculist Dr. Francis. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
has given me my sight, and I am going
home alone. Auntie doesn&#8217;t know about it
yet; she only knows that the operation
was performed two months ago, and that
Dr. Francis had no doubt of its success.
Won&#8217;t she be surprised to see me walk into
the parlor, and to hear the whole story from
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Eric, excitedly, tossing
his cap high in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember you well,&#8221; said Nettie; &#8220;I
am Nettie Hyde. Don&#8217;t you, Eric?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Eric. &#8220;I used to pity you
so! Isn&#8217;t it just jolly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said the boy, whose name
was Allan Ramsdell, &#8220;I never saw a steamer
before to-day! I have been blind so long,
ever since I was four years old. I&#8217;ve got
the key of my state-room here, but I don&#8217;t
know where to go to look for the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; volunteered Eric. &#8220;And,
Nettie, if you will go down for Adele and
Herbie, we&#8217;ll go all over the steamer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>Nettie ran quickly into the cabin, eager to
impart the news of their new acquaintance.
Mrs. Hyde was glad of anything that would
interest Adele, and urged her to go upon
deck with Herbert. Mr. Nichols was resting
from the fatigue of the ride. Mrs.
Nichols, always feeble, did not feel equal to
the exertion of climbing the companion way,
the stairs from the upper deck to the cabin,
and Mrs. Hyde wished to remain with her;
so the children began their exploring expedition
alone.</p>
<p>The great steamship was now out in the
blue sea. The wide decks were gradually
being cleared of passengers as they sought
their narrow state-rooms, and as the children
were quiet and orderly, no one interfered
with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the dining-hall,&#8221; announced Eric,
as the five heads peered in at the door of a
long saloon, where tables were ranged for
the accommodation of the passengers.</p>
<p>Behind this saloon was the kitchen, a hot,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
steaming place, where men, mostly cooks,
in dirty white jackets, rushed helter-skelter
into each other and around the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many cooks spoil the broth,&#8221; said
Herbert, in an undertone, which remark so
tickled the others that they all ran off laughing,
till they met a stout, dignified &#8220;yellow
man,&#8221; holding the store-room keys, and wearing
a cleaner jacket than the others. He was
the steward, and, being cross, scolded the
children roundly for getting in his way. In
the lower cabin were the steerage passengers.
These had no saloon with tables arranged
for their accommodation. They ate plain
bean soup from tin mugs, and hard ship
biscuit from their hands, and their table was
a long board, let down from above by ropes.
They stood around the board while eating,
and when the meal was finished, the temporary
table was drawn up out of the way.</p>
<p>By the time these observations had been
made Mrs. Hyde joined them; and after
speaking kind congratulations to Allan, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
inviting him to attach himself to their party,
she warned the children of the approach
of dinner, and requested them to prepare
for it.</p>
<p>Allan was very grateful to Mrs. Hyde for
her kindness, and thanked her politely. He
travelled with her to his aunt&#8217;s door, and
was such a gentlemanly, companionable boy
that they all became very much attached to
him. It would be pleasant to take the
trip from Hamburg to the western coast with
our party; but that is impossible, as Eric
has considerable journeying to do in another
direction, and we are to accompany him.
But the voyage was a pleasant one, and the
children saw and learned many new and
wonderful things before they reached their
destination. We must not forget that little
Froll left Hamburg snugly packed in a
cage, and intrusted to mauma&#8217;s care for the
voyage. She was quite a favorite aboard
the vessel, and made much merriment by her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
absurd pranks, and at Hague was safely
landed, and transported to the hotel.</p>
<p>At Hague, too, the Hydes and Allan
Ramsdell left the vessel, after a sorrowful
parting with Mr. and Mrs. Nichols and
Herbert and Adele.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>THE CITY.</h3>
</div>

<p>It would seem strange to us to hear our
native city called &#8220;the Boston,&#8221; and
stranger still to hear the staid old capital
called by more names than one.</p>
<p>Eric, and Allan, and Nettie were quite
confused in the capital of Holland by the
variety of names given it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hague,&#8221; &#8220;The Hague,&#8221; and &#8220;La Haye&#8221;
they had heard, but upon their arrival they
found its inhabitants calling it &#8220;<i>Gravenhaag</i>,&#8221;
which, Mrs. Hyde explained, meant
&#8220;The Count&#8217;s Meadow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a comical place!&#8221; Nettie exclaimed,
as they glided along through &#8220;canal streets&#8221;
to the hotel. &#8220;Mamma, if our streets were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
like these, wouldn&#8217;t you fret for our precious
necks every time we looked out of a window?
And I don&#8217;t suppose you would ever let us
go out to play, for fear we&#8217;d drown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, it is very pleasant gliding under
these shady trees; and if you look about,
my dear, you will see there are also carriage
roads, with sidewalks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Eric; &#8220;we&#8217;ve passed several.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like these boat roads best,&#8221; said Allan,
&#8220;they are so novel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we going, mamma?&#8221; asked
Nettie, &#8220;and how far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the <i>Vyverberg House</i>, my dear. I
do not know the distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a mile?&#8221; asked Eric, of the boatman.</p>
<p>He shook his head, saying, &#8220;<i>Nein</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you are not to think that he meant
nine miles, for &#8220;<i>nein</i>&#8221; is German for &#8220;no.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Vyverberg House was at the north
end of Gravenhaag; so our friends had a
fine view of the town, and learned much of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
its history from the sober old boatman, who,
very fortunately for them, spoke English
well.</p>
<p>He pointed out the moat, which surrounded
the city and formed its principal
defense, and the drawbridges which crossed
the moat.</p>
<p>&#8220;How different from Hamburg!&#8221; said
Eric. &#8220;There, a strong wall fortified the
town, and most of its streets are now built
upon its old walls of fortification.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The canals were similar to these,&#8221; said
his mother. &#8220;You did not notice those
particularly, because you always rode in Mr.
Nichols&#8217;s carriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is a much better looking town
than Hamburg, mamma.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; the buildings are much
handsomer here,&#8221; she assented.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, how lovely!&#8221; &#8220;How splendid!&#8221; cried
Nettie and Allan in a breath, as they came
upon a fine open space, ornamented with a
lake, and wooded island in its centre.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is the Vyverberg,&#8221; the boatman
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma, how good of you to bring us
here!&#8221; cried the children; &#8220;it is perfectly
splendid!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well might they say so. The square
containing the lovely lake and island was
surrounded by the handsomest and chief
public edifices of the city, the finest one of
them all being the former palace of Prince
Maurice, now the National Museum, celebrated
for its gallery of pictures.</p>
<p>The Royal Museum and other famous
buildings were there; but that to which our
party&#8217;s attention was most closely drawn was
the hotel.</p>
<p>It stood facing the lake, a broad, comfortable-looking
brick building, with heavy balconies,
and frowning eaves and ornamental
stucco work surrounded its doorways and
windows. Between it and the avenue lay a
beautiful garden, and just beyond the building
was a small shady grove.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma,&#8221; exclaimed Nettie, &#8220;I <i>do</i> think
the Germans and Dutch have the most exquisite
gardens in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are certainly very beautiful,&#8221; said
Mrs. Hyde. &#8220;Here in Holland great attention
is paid to the culture of flowers. Indeed,
some of the finest varieties are raised here,
and Holland bulbs are among our choicest
varieties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hyde, I suppose I am very
stupid,&#8221; said Allan, blushing, &#8220;but I do not
know what &#8216;bulbs&#8217; are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed, Allan; you show great good
sense in asking about whatever you do not
understand. That is the way to learn.
Bulbous plants are those which have a round
root, and produce very few leaves; they are
such as the tulip, hyacinth, crocus, and
others. They are nearly all ornamental and
beautiful from the very large size and brilliant
color of their flowers. Holland tulips
were once so much in demand as to bring
almost fabulous prices. A gentleman in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
Syracuse gave a valuable span of horses,
and another exchanged his farm, for a bed of
the tulip bulbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Allan. &#8220;It is
very interesting. When I am a man I
think I will be a florist. I am very fond of
flowers; they were a great comfort to me
when I was blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Allan ceased speaking, the boat
stopped, and they were landed upon a
short flight of stone steps. Eric gave
directions for the baggage, and then all
proceeded to the hotel.</p>
<p>A carriage was approaching them quite
rapidly, and Nettie suddenly, with a cry of
joy, sprang forward, directly in the way of
the horses. If Allan had not, at the risk
of serious injury to himself, immediately
sprung after her and drawn her back, she
would have been run over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go of me, Allan; O, let me go!
It is papa!&#8221; cried Nettie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>A gentleman in the carriage stopped the
horses, and leaned anxiously forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the little girl hurt?&#8221; he asked of
Allan, in German.</p>
<p>Poor Allan did not understand him, and
could not answer. But there was no need,
for in another instant, exclaiming, &#8220;Why, &#8217;tis
my own little girl!&#8221; the gentleman leaped
from the carriage, and Nettie was in her
father&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Hyde and Eric, who
had been separated by carriages from them,
and had only seen Nettie spring before the
horses, and Allan go after her, were very
much frightened. They now appeared upon
the scene, and finding the child sobbing in a
gentleman&#8217;s arms, concluded, of course, that
she was hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;My darling!&#8221; cried poor Mrs. Hyde, in
agony, &#8220;O, is she hurt, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Allan, &#8220;she is not
hurt, at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice!&#8221; said Mr. Hyde to his wife.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>He had but just landed from the American
steamer, and was on his way to the hotel,
not knowing of the arrival of &#8220;The Hague,&#8221;
when he first saw Nettie and Allan. He
was overjoyed to find his family thus unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, Eric, Eric! I am so glad!&#8221; she exclaimed,
in relief; &#8220;but Nettie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My little rash, excitable Nettie is safe
and sound in papa&#8217;s arms,&#8221; he said. But
the tremor in his voice showed how nearly
Nettie had escaped severe injury. &#8220;Eric, my
boy,&#8221; he added, &#8220;have you no word for papa?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric, white and faint, could not speak a
word, but clasped his father&#8217;s hand convulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is my daughter&#8217;s brave protector
and deliverer?&#8221; Mr. Hyde asked,
looking around for Allan.</p>
<p>The boy, who had bashfully retreated
behind Mrs. Hyde, was brought forward and
introduced as &#8220;our neighbor the blind boy,
whose sight is now restored.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He is travelling home with us,&#8221; Mrs.
Hyde added, when her husband had warmly
thanked him.</p>
<p>Quite a crowd had collected around our
travellers, and so eagerly and sympathetically
inquired what had happened, that Mr.
Hyde was obliged to tell them, briefly, the
incident, as he led the way to the Vyverberg
House.</p>
<p>It was but a few steps, and they were
soon in the hotel, where the words of congratulation
floated after them from the
crowd; and presently a hearty cheer followed,
when the good Hollanders understood
that the little American <i>Fraulien</i> had
found her father.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>ALLAN&#8217;S STORY.</h3>
</div>

<p>Poor Nettie was mortified enough by
the result of her impulsive act. She
was quite frightened by the crowd, and their
joyous cheering filled her with terror, for
she did not understand that these honest,
kindly people were filled with joy because a
little girl&#8217;s heart was made happy.</p>
<p>Her parents talked to her kindly and
seriously of the necessity of learning to
govern her impulsiveness, and Nettie promised;
but, alas! the promise was broken
again and again, until she learned by hard
and terrible experience to be a careful,
thoughtful child. She now found that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
had spoiled every one&#8217;s pleasure for the
day.</p>
<p>Her mother suffered from a nervous headache,
brought on by the fright and excitement.
Her father was obliged to leave,
when they were comfortably established in
the hotel, in order to transact some important
business, and had taken Eric with him,
starting immediately after their dinner.</p>
<p>When he went off with Eric, Mrs. Hyde
went to her room to lie down, forbidding
Nettie to leave the parlor, that she might
feel assured of the child&#8217;s safety.</p>
<p>Allan had a letter to write to Dr. Francis
and his friends in Hamburg; so Nettie
was obliged to amuse herself.</p>
<p>She obtained permission from her mamma
to take Froll out upon the balcony, and
played with her for a little while quite
happily. But by and by Froll spoiled all
the fun; for she <i>would</i> climb up the blinds
and mouldings to the utmost limit of her
chain, which was just long enough to admit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
of her reaching the window-sill and thrusting
her head into the room where Mrs. Hyde lay.
Now, Mrs. Hyde was really afraid of Froll,
and these performances were not calculated
to cure her headache. She spoke to Nettie
once or twice from the room; but finding the
monkey&#8217;s visits repeated, she sent Allan
down to tell Nettie that, if Froll came up
to her window again, she must return to her
cage, and Nettie to the parlor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let her go up again,&#8221; said Nettie.
&#8220;Now, Froll, be good; <i>do</i> climb down the
other way, after this cake. See, Frolic,
see!&#8221; and she threw a little fruit cake over
the railing.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash, Froll went after it; so
very quickly, as to pull the end of the chain
from Nettie&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>Before the child had time to think, the
mischievous monkey had seized the cake,
and was travelling quickly up the blinds
and moulding, over the sill, and, as Nettie
drew a frightened breath, in at the window.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;O, dear!&#8221; said Nettie; &#8220;now I&#8217;ll have to
be punished. It&#8217;s silly of mamma to be so
easily frightened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mamma, meanwhile, had just fallen
into a doze. The rattling of the chain
startled her; she opened her eyes, and saw
the ugly little black monkey perched close
beside her. She was quite startled, and
very angry with Nettie, of course: after
securing the monkey safely in her cage, she
called Nettie to her, and speaking quite
severely, told her to return to the parlor, to
sit down on the lounge, and neither to rise
from it, nor touch anything, until her father
and Eric came home. Poor Nettie! It was
very dull indeed for her, and before long she
was sobbing quite bitterly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Allan finished his letter, and
took up his cap, meaning to take a walk
around the square. Looking into the parlor,
and seeing Nettie&#8217;s distress, he resolved to
give up his walk and to comfort Nettie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t cry, Nettie,&#8221; he said, so softly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
and kindly that she stopped crying, and
looked up at him. &#8220;I will stay with you
now. I&#8217;ve written my letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nettie&#8217;s face lighted up instantly, but fell
again as she exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is not fair, Allan: you told Eric
you should take a walk; mamma is very
unkind and unjust, too! I could not help
Froll&#8217;s going up that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, Nettie,&#8221; said Allan, &#8220;don&#8217;t ever speak
so of your mother, so kind and good. My
mamma is dead, Nettie; and if yours should
ever be laid away in the cold, cold ground,
you would feel so dreadfully to think you
had wronged her!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nettie was crying again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> love mamma, and it was very bad
of me to speak so; but, O, dear! I never
<i>do</i> do anything right. I don&#8217;t see why I
can&#8217;t be good, like Adele.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what makes Adele so good and
gentle,&#8221; said Allan. &#8220;She loves the Lord,
and tries to please him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>I can&#8217;t</i>!&#8221; said Nettie, piteously.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, yes, you can, Nettie. Every one can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grown-up people can, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And children too,&#8221; said Allan, earnestly.
&#8220;Let me tell you a story auntie used
to tell me, when I was blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nettie assented, and Allan repeated the
story of &#8220;Little Cristelle,&#8221; unconscious, the
while, that he was fulfilling the teaching of
song in ministering to Nettie.</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Slowly forth from the village church,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>The voice of the choristers hushed overhead,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Came little Cristelle. She paused in the porch,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Pondering what the preacher had said.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Even the youngest, humblest child</i></p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'><i>Something may do to please the Lord.</i>&#8217;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8216;Now what,&#8217; thought she, and half sadly smiled,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>&#8216;Can I, so little and poor, afford?&#8217;</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Never, never a day should pass,</i></p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'><i>Without some kindness kindly shown</i>,&#8217;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>The preacher said. Then down to the grass</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>A skylark dropped, like a brown-winged stone.</p>
<br />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Well, a day is before me now;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Yet what,&#8217; thought she, &#8216;can I do, if I try?</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>If an angel of God would show me how!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>But silly am I, and the hours they fly.&#8217;</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Then the lark sprang, singing, up from the sod,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And the maiden thought, as he rose to the blue,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8216;He says he will carry my prayer to God;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>But who would have thought the little lark knew?&#8217;</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Now she entered the village street</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>With book in hand and face demure;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And soon she came, with sober feet,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>To a crying babe at a cottage door.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;It wept at a windmill that would not move,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>It puffed with its round red cheeks in vain;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>One sail stuck fast in a puzzling groove,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And baby&#8217;s breath could not stir it again.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;So baby beat the sail, and cried,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>While no one came from the cottage door;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>But little Cristelle knelt down by its side,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And set the windmill going once more.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Then baby was pleased, and the little girl</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Was glad, when she heard it laugh and crow,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Thinking, &#8216;Happy windmill that has but to whirl</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>To please the pretty young creature so!&#8217;</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;No thought of herself was in her head,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>As she passed out at the end of the street,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And came to a rose tree, tall and red,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Drooping and faint with summer heat.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;She ran to a brook that was flowing by,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>She made of her two hands a nice round cup,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And washed the roots of the rose tree high,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Till it lifted its languid blossoms up.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;O, happy brook!&#8217; thought little Cristelle;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>&#8216;You have done some good this summer&#8217;s day:</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>You have made the flowers look fresh and well.&#8217;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Then she rose, and went on her way.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;But she saw, as she walked by the side of the brook,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Some great rough stones, that troubled its course,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And the gurgling water seemed to say, &#8216;Look!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>I struggle, and tumble, and murmur hoarse.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;How these stones obstruct my road!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>How I wish they were off and gone!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Then I would flow, as once I flowed,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Singing in silvery undertone.&#8217;</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Then little Cristelle, as bright as a bird,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Put off the shoes from her young, white feet;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>She moves two stones, she comes to the third;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>The brook already sings, &#8216;Thanks! Sweet! Sweet!&#8217;</p>
<br />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;O, then she hears the lark in the skies,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And thinks, &#8216;What is it to God he says?&#8217;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And she tumbles and falls, and cannot rise,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>For the water stifles her downward face.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;The little brook flows on as before,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>The little lark sings with as sweet a sound,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>The little babe crows at the cottage door,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And the red rose blooms; but Cristelle lies drowned!</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Come in softly; this is the room.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Is not that an innocent face?</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Yes, those flowers give a faint perfume:</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Think, child, of heaven, and our Lord his grace.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Three at the right, and three at the left,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Two at the feet, and two at the head,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>The tapers burn; the friends bereft</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Have cried till their eyes are swollen and red.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Who would have thought it, when little Cristelle</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Pondered on what the preacher had told?</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>But the wise God does all things well,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And the fair young creature lies dead and cold!</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Then the little stream crept into the place,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And rippled up to the coffin&#8217;s side,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And touched the corpse on its pale round face,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And kissed the eyes till they trembled wide,&mdash;</p>
<br />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Saying, &#8216;I am a river of joy from Heaven;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>You helped the brook, and I help you;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>I sprinkle your brows with life-drops seven;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>I bathe your eyes with healing dew.&#8217;</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Then a rose branch in through the window came,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And colored her lips and cheeks with red;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8216;I remember, and Heaven does the same,&#8217;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Was all that the faithful rose branch said.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Then a bright, small form to her cold neck clung;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>It breathed on her till her breast did fill,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Saying, &#8216;I am a cherub fond and young,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And I saw who breathed on the baby&#8217;s mill.&#8217;</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Then little Cristelle sat up and smiled,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And said, &#8216;Who put these flowers in my hand?&#8217;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And rubbed her eyes&mdash;poor innocent child&mdash;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Not being able to understand.</p>
<br />
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;But soon she heard the big bell of the church</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Give the hour; which made her say,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8216;Ah! I have slept and dreamt in this porch.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>It is a very drowsy day!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; said Nettie, drawing a long, deep
breath, &#8220;I think, Allan, that it&#8217;s the most
beautiful story I ever heard. Do you know
who wrote it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Allan. &#8220;I used to think it
was auntie&#8217;s own; but I asked her once, and
she said, &#8216;O, no, indeed!&#8217; and that she did
not know who wrote it, but thought it was a
translation from the German.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Adele would have liked that so much!&#8221;
said Nettie thoughtfully, &#8220;and she would
have been just like little Cristelle, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Allan, &#8220;I think she would;
and that would have been because both of
them were trying to please the Lord. Don&#8217;t
you see, Nettie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But after all, Allan, it is not a true
story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an allegory,&#8221; said Allan. &#8220;It means
that if we do every little simple kindness for
the sake of helping others and pleasing the
Lord, that we shall be children of the Lord,
and live in heaven with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Allan, you are one of the &#8216;children
of the Lord;&#8217; for you do kind, generous
things all the time, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Nettie,&#8221; said Allan, hastily interrupting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
her. &#8220;I am very selfish, and I
have to try very hard, and pray to the Lord
Jesus to help me to be good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you <i>do</i> give up for the sake of others,
you know; now this afternoon&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am having a delightful time, and enjoying
myself hugely,&#8221; said Allan, interrupting
her again, and laughing merrily.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and get my checker-board, and we&#8217;ll
have a game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, thanks to the kind-hearted Allan,
the afternoon wore pleasantly away, and
when Mrs. Hyde and Eric returned, Allan
and Nettie were both very happy, and in the
midst of an exciting game. Mrs. Hyde had
slept off her headache, and was giving orders
for tea on the balcony, to the children&#8217;s intense
satisfaction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>&#8220;SEEING THE ELEPHANT.&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You must wake and call me early,
call me early, mother dear,&#8217;&#8221; sang
Nettie, as she leaned over the balcony railing,
gazing out upon the lovely lake and
island before them; for Mr. Hyde had explained
that, as his time was exceedingly limited,
he could allow them only three days to
explore Havenhaag, and at the end of that
time they must leave for New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we will begin with the Royal Museum
to-morrow morning,&#8221; he added; &#8220;and all
who are up in good season can take a trip
with me, in one of those shallops, around the
lake.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>After the children had retired, Mr. and
Mrs. Hyde held a consultation about Eric.
They expected the arrival of Dr. Ward and
their nephew daily, and were in hopes of
seeing them before the steamer should sail.
But there was just a chance that the doctor
might be delayed at Paris; and if it should so
happen, what would Eric do?</p>
<p>His parents were unwilling to disappoint
him by taking him to New York without
making the desired tour of Germany; and
they disliked the idea of leaving him, a young
boy of thirteen, alone in a strange place.</p>
<p>But his father at length decided to let him
remain at the Vyverberg House, in case the
doctor should be detained until after they had
sailed.</p>
<p>Eric was a thoughtful, reliable boy, and
old enough, his father said, to learn to depend
upon himself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hyde felt some misgivings as to this
course at first; but her confidence in Eric was
so great, that she soon consented to it, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
having once decided in favor of the plan, she
would let no thought of it trouble her.</p>
<p>You may be sure that the three children
did not need an &#8220;early call&#8221; in the morning,
for they were up and dressed with the daylight,
having a romp on their balcony with
Froll, who frightened several of the occupants
of adjacent rooms by trying to get in
at their windows.</p>
<p>Nettie told Eric how Froll had got her into
disgrace, the day before, by the same trick.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Eric, &#8220;that she must once
have belonged to an organ-grinder, and have
been taught to climb up for money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; said Allan. &#8220;But you had
better break her of the trick. People, as a
general thing, are not fond of the sudden appearance
of a black monkey at their chamber
windows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s papa!&#8221; cried Nettie. &#8220;Now for
our sail!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Mrs. Hyde coming?&#8221; Allan asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here she is! Good morning, mamma,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
and&mdash;O, Eric, mind Froll!&#8221; cried Nettie;
but too late, for Froll had darted from him,
and gone in at an open window above.</p>
<p>There was a breathless silence.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hyde were very much annoyed,
and the children were alarmed for the
safety of their pet.</p>
<p>While they were momentarily expecting a
scream of terror from the occupant of the
room, Froll reappeared at the window, and,
with a grin and chatter of defiance, tumbled
out, and clambered down towards the children,
with a pair of gold-rimmed eye-glasses in
her hand. A night-capped head, thrust out
after her, was withdrawn again hastily, as its
owner&#8217;s eyes encountered those of Mrs. Hyde.</p>
<p>Saucy Froll perched herself upon the top
of the parlor blind, stuck the glasses upon
her nose, and peered down at the children,
who greeted this man&oelig;uvre with an irresistible
burst of laughter, in which their father and
mother joined.</p>
<p>The owner of the glasses again thrust his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
head out at the window, minus the nightcap
this time, and seeing the monkey, laughed as
heartily as the others.</p>
<p>Leaning forward, he could reach the chain,
which he caught; and then Froll was made
to surrender her plunder; after which she
was committed to her cage in disgrace.</p>
<p>The sail on the lake was delightful. The
water was as smooth as glass, the air fresh
and cool, and the little island in the lake&#8217;s
centre was crowded with song birds, whose
sweet, merry notes rang musically over the
water, and were echoed back from the shore.</p>
<p>After breakfast they prepared to visit the
places of interest in &#8220;Gravenhaag.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hyde led the way to the National
Museum, occupying the Prince Maurice palace&mdash;an
elegant building of the seventeenth
century. Numerous guides offered their services,
and when one had been engaged, our
party followed him up a broad, solid stairway
to the famous picture gallery. Most of the
paintings were old pieces of the German masters,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
and did not interest the children so
much as their parents, for they were too
young to appreciate them. But in one of
the rooms almost entirely covering one end,
was a grand picture, so vivid and natural
that Nettie was quite startled by it at first.
It was a picture of a young bull spotted white
and brown, a cow lazily resting on the grass
before it, a few sheep in different attitudes,
and an aged cowherd leaning upon a fence.
The background of the picture was a distant
landscape, and all the objects were life-size.</p>
<p>&#8220;That picture is Paul Potter&#8217;s Bull&mdash;a
highly prized work of art,&#8221; said Mr. Hyde.
&#8220;When the French invaded Holland, Napoleon
ordered it to Paris, to be hung in
the Louvre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it didn&#8217;t go, as it&#8217;s here now,&#8221;
remarked Allan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was carried there, and excited
much admiration. But when Holland was
free of the French, and Germany victorious,
the painting was reclaimed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>The children could have staid, gazing
with delight upon it, for a much longer time
than was allowed them. The guide soon
led the way to the Royal Museum of Curiosities,
and they reluctantly followed. The
collection of curiosities was in the lower
part of the building, and here they saw all
kinds of Chinese and Japanese articles,
which, the guide informed them, was the
largest and best collection of the kind in the
world.</p>
<p>There was enough here to interest our
young folks, and old folks, too.</p>
<p>All kinds of merchandise and manufactures,
and most interesting and complicated
toys, model cities, barges gayly-colored and
filled with tiny men at work on tinier oars,
pagodas, shops, temples, huts, houses,
vehicles, and men, women, and children in
every variety of costume, engaged in every
conceivable employment.</p>
<p>So fascinating was this Museum that the
entire morning was most agreeably spent in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
it; and there was but just time, before leaving
it, to look into the historical department,
where were many objects of interest, and
among other things the armor and weapons
of De Ruyter, the famous admiral. At any
other time these would have possessed great
interest for the boys; but now they rather
slighted them for the unique toys of China
and Japan.</p>
<p>After their dinner and a half hour&#8217;s rest,
the children paid a visit to the king&#8217;s palace;
for Gravenhaag, you must know, is the
favorite residence of the king and court.</p>
<p>Nettie and the boys walked very carefully,
and held themselves very properly, such a
thing as a visit to the king&#8217;s palace not
being a daily event with them. Although
she would not have missed going for anything,
Nettie was a little alarmed at their
situation, as they drew near to the palace,
a large Grecian building, with two wings,
forming three sides of a square. She had
an idea that whenever kings were displeased
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
with people, they ordered their heads to be
cut off; and she wondered if he <i>would</i> be
pleased to have their party looking at his
possessions. Her fears were groundless,
however.</p>
<p>As they reached the square, they saw, near
the entrance to the palace, a fine-looking
man, well dressed and gentlemanly, who
smiled kindly at the children, and, seeing
their eager scrutiny of the palace, politely
invited them to enter it.</p>
<p>The boys were delighted, but Nettie declared
that she was afraid of the king.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, the king will not trouble you, my
little maid,&#8221; said the stranger, in excellent
English: &#8220;walk in, walk in!&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hand to Nettie, and was
such a kind, pleasant-looking man, that
Nettie&#8217;s fears vanished. She gave him her
hand, and the two boys followed her into the
palace. Yes, actually <i>into</i> it, when, a few
minutes before, she had hardly dared venture
a terrified glance at the outside, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
was momentarily expecting the stern command,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Off with their heads!&#8221;</p>
<p>Their new friend led them to a lovely
garden, gave them flowers and fruit, and
chatted gayly with them all the time. Then
he took them to several apartments of the
palace, and finally into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>The children noticed that every one made
a respectful bow to their kind escort, and
concluded that he must be some great nobleman;
but judge of their surprise, when they
found themselves being presented by him to
a beautiful, pale lady, quietly dressed in
black.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alicia, my dear,&#8221; said their nobleman,
still speaking in English, &#8220;I have brought
these young American travellers to see you.
My little friends,&#8221; to the children, &#8220;yonder
lady is the <i>Queen of Holland</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t <i>that</i> enough to confuse the best
bred child in the world?</p>
<p>Poor Eric had a faint idea that he must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
kiss the queen&#8217;s toe, as a mark of courtesy,
and stepped forward, with a dizzy singing in
his ears, to do so. But he was saved from
such a ridiculous situation by the gentle
queen, who smiled and extended her hand;
then Eric thankfully remembered that it was
the queen&#8217;s hand and the pope&#8217;s toe. So he
bent gracefully forward and kissed Queen
Alicia&#8217;s white fingers.</p>
<p>Allan, of course, did the same. And
Nettie had no time to consider what she
must do, for the queen had kissed her quite
warmly at first, and their strange guide had
drawn her to his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you fear the king, little maid?&#8221;
he asked, so kindly that Nettie confessed
her idea of majestic temperaments. How
he laughed! and how the queen laughed,
too!</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I suppose you will want to go to
mamma,&#8221; he said, soon afterwards; and giving
them each a gold coin, added, &#8220;Keep
these to remember me by, and you can tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
your friends that the <i>King of Holland</i> gave
them to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The children were perfectly amazed, and
could not speak their thanks properly; but
of this the king took no notice. He led
them to the entrance on the street, and then
kindly said, &#8220;Good by.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hyde, who had become
quite anxious over their long delay, were
much relieved to see the children come
safely home just before tea-time. They
were quite as much astonished, by the account
of the visit, as our young folks had
supposed they would be.</p>
<p>Tea, on the balcony, and some quiet
music in the evening, finished up the day;
and when the tired children sought their
pillows, they quickly fell asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>A DUTCH CITY.</h3>
</div>

<p>It would take too long to mention all the
sights seen and famous places visited
by the travellers in Gravenhaag.</p>
<p>They were admitted to the palace of the
Prince of Orange, and saw his famous collection
of paintings and chalk drawings.
They went over the <i>Binnenhof</i>, which is a
collection of ancient stone buildings, containing
a handsome Gothic hall, and the prison
in which Grotius and Barneveldt were confined,
the churches, synagogues, and the
royal library, and walked on the <i>Voorhout</i>,
a beautiful promenade, with a fine, wide
road lined with shade trees and furnished
with benches, to the <i>Bosch</i>, a finely wooded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
park belonging to the King of Holland. In
its centre, reached by winding walks among
the trees and beautiful lakes, stands the
<i>Huys in den Bosch</i>&mdash;house in the wood&mdash;the
king&#8217;s summer palace.</p>
<p>After visiting all these places, and the
printing establishments and iron foundery,
Mr. Hyde, finding he had another day before
the steamer sailed, took them all to Rotterdam.
They went by railway to the city,
and drove around it in an open carriage, like
a barouche, which was waiting at the depot.
Mr. Hyde, who had been there before, was
quite familiar with the place. He ordered
the coachman to drive through the High
Street; and soon the children found themselves
on a street considerably higher than
the others, lined with shops, and looking
very pleasant and busy. Mr. Hyde told
them it was built upon the dam which prevented
the Maas River from overflowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is the only street in Rotterdam,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;which has not a canal in its
centre.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Queen of Holland.</span>&mdash;Page 61.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>When they had gone the length of High
Street, they came to street after street, each
having a canal in the middle, lined with trees
on both sides, and exhibiting a medley of
high gable fronts of houses, trees, and masts
of shipping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; cried Nettie; &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
live in such a place for the world. It&#8217;s
pretty to look at; but think of having those
ships going by right under the drawing-room
windows. They make me giddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many canals!&#8221; cried Allan. &#8220;They
go lengthwise and crosswise through every
street but the High.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And these clumsy bridges,&#8221; said Nettie
again, pointing to the drawbridges of white
painted wood which they saw at every little
distance; they were made of large, heavy
beams overhead, and lifted by chains for the
vessels to pass through.</p>
<p>Under the trees, beside the canals, were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
yellow brick &#8220;sidewalks,&#8221; as Nettie called
them; but they were really quays, for the
landing of goods.</p>
<p>Between the trees and the houses, on a
coarse, rough pavement, among carts, drays,
and carriages, walked the foot passengers
quite frequently. For though there were
sidewalks close to the houses, little outbuildings
and flights of steps to doorways were
continually in the way, and it was &#8220;impossible
for one to walk straight along, or at all
fast, on any of them,&#8221; as the children said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma,&#8221; said Nettie, &#8220;I should think
they would break their necks every minute.
Just look at those canals, right in the street,
and nothing to keep people from falling into
them. What do they do in dark nights?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do they light the streets, papa?&#8221;
asked Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;By oil lamps, hung on ropes from the
houses to the trees,&#8221; said Mr. Hyde. &#8220;They
have gas on the High Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allan&#8217;s attention had been attracted by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
some curious little structures outside the
lower windows of several of the houses.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking-glasses,&#8221; said Mr. Hyde.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking-glasses, papa! <i>Outside</i> their
windows?&#8221; exclaimed Nettie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear; they are hung so as to reflect
the passing objects to the people inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they can see whatever is going on
in the streets below, without coming to the
windows,&#8221; said Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a funny custom!&#8221; exclaimed
Nettie, again.</p>
<p>The only building they visited was the
Church of St. Lawrence, where they saw
the famous great organ, a splendid structure,
larger than the great organs of Haarlem
and Boston. It is one hundred and
fifty feet high, mounted upon a colonnade
fifty feet high, and has five thousand five
hundred pipes.</p>
<p>In the market-place they saw a statue of
the great scholar Erasmus, and &#8220;the house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
where he was born,&#8221; which is now, alas! a
gin-shop. From the <i>Boomptjes</i>, a fine quay,
planted with rows of beautiful trees, and
surrounded by elegant, dark brick mansions,
our party chartered a little sail boat, and
went out upon the Maas.</p>
<p>The beautiful, quiet Maas, with Rotterdam&#8217;s
green, woody banks in view; the blue,
blue sky, seen clearly in the limpid waters;
the steamers coming and going, and birds
flying around, adding their sweet notes to
nature&#8217;s harmony&mdash;this beautiful picture
was one remembered by the children all their
lives. To-morrow&#8217;s parting hung its shadow
over them, and softened their hearts to the
true beauty everywhere expressed.</p>
<p>The sun had set when they reached the
Vyverberg for the last time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma,&#8221; said Eric, regretfully, &#8220;I
almost wish I was going home with you
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Charlie may come to-night,&#8221; said
his mother, cheerfully. &#8220;At any rate, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
will soon come. You would then wish you
had staid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Eric. &#8220;But it is very
hard to let you all go home without me, for
all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very careful directions were given to
Eric, and he was placed under the care of
the landlord until he should hear from his
uncle.</p>
<p>The evening was very short to Eric, who
lingered by his mother, and could not bear
to leave her side, knowing he should see her
no more for a long, long year.</p>
<p>Long after Nettie and Allan had left them,
he staid with his parents, listening to their
last kind advice, and sending little loving
messages to his cousins and schoolmates.</p>
<p>In the morning he saw them off with a
heavy heart. His father&#8217;s last kind words,
Allan&#8217;s affectionate greeting, Nettie&#8217;s tears,
and his promise to his mother that he would
remember his prayers and daily chapter in
the Bible, and would try to make his travels
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
a useful, profitable study, and to keep himself
truthful, honest, and kind, were mixed
up with a hearty, homesick longing to go
after them. His eyes filled with tears as the
stretch of water between him and his dear
ones rapidly widened; he turned from the
wharf with a sorrowful face, slowly and
sadly retracing his steps to the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dismal it will be! how lonely and
dismal without them!&#8221; He thought and
murmured sorrowfully,&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>UNDER THE SEA.</h3>
</div>

<p>Eric had been but a few minutes in the
parlor at the hotel, and was trying to
amuse himself with little Froll, when there
came a tap upon the door, and the servant
entered with a card.</p>
<p>Eric read the name,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>EMIL LACELLE,</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>and written underneath,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'><i>No. 365 Vyverberg House.</i></p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Who in the world,&#8221; thought Eric, &#8220;is
Emil Lacelle? and what did he send this to
me for?&#8221;</p>
<p>The waiter explained that the gentleman
was waiting, in his room, up stairs; and Eric,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
with Froll on his shoulder, started for No.
365.</p>
<p>The door stood open, disclosing a pleasant
room, with various kinds of odd-looking
armor lying around: seated by a table was
a gentleman dressed in black, whom Eric
recognized at once as the one whose glasses
Froll had stolen.</p>
<p>This gentleman was looking for Eric, and
said at once, when he entered the room,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am pleased to see you, monsieur,&#8221; and
politely requested him to be seated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you speak French?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very well, sir,&#8221; answered Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;German?&#8221; inquired the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;And English?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; I am an American.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a Frenchman,&#8221; said Mr. Lacelle.
&#8220;I want you, if you please, to do me a little
service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do anything that I can for you,&#8221;
said Eric. &#8220;I am very much obliged to you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
already for being so good-natured about your
glasses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not mention it!&#8221; Mr. Lacelle exclaimed,
with the natural politeness of a
Frenchman. &#8220;I have taken quite a fancy to
your playful little beast.&#8221; And he coaxed
the monkey to him, and gently stroked her
soft hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it that I can do for you, sir?&#8221;
asked Eric. He was beginning to like Mr.
Lacelle very much.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a letter to write to America, and
am not enough of an English scholar to undertake
it. Now, therefore, if I tell to you
that which I want written, would you be
so very kind, if you please, as to write for
me, it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; with much pleasure,&#8221; said
Eric; thinking the while, &#8220;No wonder he
does not like to undertake a letter in English,
when he speaks the language so clumsily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Lacelle, still holding Froll, brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
forward a traveller&#8217;s writing-desk, filled with
perfumed French paper, and then placing it
before Eric, and saying politely, &#8220;At your
convenience, <i>monsieur</i>,&#8221; he reseated himself.</p>
<p>Eric arranged the paper, took up a pen,
and after writing the date, sat waiting for his
instructions.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, what do you say to two
gentlemen?&#8221; asked Mr. Lacelle.</p>
<p>Eric was completely puzzled, and could
only say, &#8220;Sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me!&#8221; exclaimed the Frenchman,
&#8220;to <i>one</i> you would say &#8216;sir;&#8217; but to two,
would you say &#8216;sirs&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Eric, but, recollecting
some letters he had copied for his father,
added, &#8220;O, no: it&#8217;s <i>Messrs.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; said Mr. Lacelle. &#8220;I thank
you. That is fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>He appeared quite relieved, and began
dictating.

</div>
<p>&#8220;Is it quite correct English?&#8221; he asked,
anxiously.</p>
<p>Eric rewrote it, transposing some of the
words. Mr. Lacelle was very grateful for
the boy&#8217;s assistance. He was by no means
ignorant, but his knowledge of English was
rather limited, and he was too sensitive to be
willing to send off a peculiar letter.</p>
<p>Mr. Lacelle&#8217;s history would be very interesting,
had we time to give it minutely; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
there is only space to say that he was the
younger son of a noble French family, whose
circumstances during his youth were so unfortunate
that he was thrown upon his own
resources at a tender age, and had, by great
energy and perseverance, become a wealthy
and famous man.</p>
<p>Eric knew that &#8220;sub&#8221; meant under, and
&#8220;marine&#8221; the sea, but he did not understand
exactly what it all meant; so he asked Mr.
Lacelle, whose explanation and subsequent
conversation, we will render in readable English.</p>
<p>&#8220;A submarine diver is one who goes beneath
the water of the sea: professionally
he examines and clears harbors, removing
obstructions, such as rocks, &amp;c.; draws up
sunken vessels, examines wrecks, and brings
up from the depths of the ocean money,
jewels, and articles of value.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But tell me,&#8221; cried Eric, eagerly, &#8220;how
does he breathe? what protects him in the
water? how&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you all about it,&#8221; said Mr.
Lacelle. &#8220;There are several divers here in
the house. We are going to the Zuyder Zee,
near Amsterdam, to-morrow, and you shall
go too, if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, thank you, sir,&#8221; said Eric. &#8220;I would
like to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile I will tell you,&#8221; proceeded
the diver. &#8220;We wear an armor such as
this,&#8221; he explained, pointing out the several
pieces to Eric, as he noticed them.
&#8220;In the first place an India-rubber suit
like this. You will observe that it is made
entirely water-proof, by being cemented down
in the seams, wherever it is sewed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric looked with interest upon the clumsy-looking
dress, which was made entirely whole,
except the opening at the sleeves and neck,
and was cut away above the shoulders, like
a girl&#8217;s low-necked dress, to admit the body
of the wearer; the legs were footed off like
stockings, and the wrists of the sleeves were
terminated by tight, elastic rubber bands; a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
similar band surrounded the neck, which
was also finished with a flap of white rubber
facing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; continued Mr. Lacelle, &#8220;we
put ourselves into this suit, drawing it on
from the top. It is perfectly water-tight.
Upon our feet we wear shoes such as these,&#8221;
pointing to a pair of heavy leather shoes,
with broad, high straps and buckles, and
lead soles half an inch thick. &#8220;They weigh
twenty-five pounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; exclaimed Eric; &#8220;I should call
that something of a load.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The weight is imperceptible in the water,&#8221;
the diver explained, and, showing Eric a
couple of box-shaped canvas bags, added,
&#8220;We wear these also, filled with weights,
just above the waist, one before and one
behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t told me yet how you
breathe in the water,&#8221; said Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am coming to that shortly. Upon our
heads we wear a helmet, made of copper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
completely covering head, face, and neck,
and firmly inserted between the rubber facing
and the tight band about the neck of the
dress, just above the shoulders. To the
back of the helmet is fastened a rubber
hose, attached, above the water, to the pump,
which keeps the diver supplied with air; and
there is a glass window in the front. A
half-inch rope, called the life-line, is securely
adjusted to the diver, and by it he is
lowered into or drawn from the water; and
by it, also, he signals to those above for
more air, for withdrawal, or anything he
may require.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This helmet is heavy enough,&#8221; said
Eric, lifting and examining the curious structure.
&#8220;There is a valve inside: what is that
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To let the air, which the diver breathes
from his lungs, into the water,&#8221; Mr. Lacelle
replied. &#8220;This machine in the case,&#8221; pointing
to a high black-walnut case, &#8220;is a three-cylinder
air-pump; two men in the vessel, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
on the shore, keep the pumps constantly in
motion by means of the crank attached to
the wheel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do they have more than one
pump?&#8221; Eric inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;One pump,&#8221; answered Mr. Lacelle,
&#8220;would not supply enough air; it would
work like a water-pump, sending down the
air by jerks, and the receiver would be exhausted
between the supplies of air. Two
pumps would send down the air puff-puff,
like the pumps of a steam engine; but three
pumps, constantly in motion, send down,
through the hose, a steady and continuous
stream of air, enabling the diver to breathe
freely and fully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And can you go down into any depth of
water?&#8221; Eric asked, with intense interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not lower than one hundred feet, usually,
the pressure of the water is so great.
I have been down one hundred and fifty-six
feet below the surface; but that was
something very remarkable.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And did you never have any hair-breadth
escapes, or thrilling adventures?&#8221; inquired
Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered the diver, with a slight
laugh and shrug of the shoulders, &#8220;I never
did, and never knew any one who did, although
I have read of many such incidents,
altogether too marvellous for belief. You
see,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;we know that the least
carelessness would probably cost us our lives,
and we are minutely accurate about all our
equipments. And,&#8221; lowering his voice and
speaking reverentially, &#8220;I always commit
myself to the guidance and tender care of
the good Shepherd.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They that go down to the sea in ships,
that do business in great waters,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;These see the works of the Lord, and
his wonders in the deep.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They cry unto the Lord in their trouble,
and he bringeth them out of their distress.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric listened, and his respect and esteem
for the diver grew tenfold more.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>Mr. Lacelle continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a strange business. The danger
fascinates some, but the peril is never lost
sight of. I put on the helmet, for the first
time, more than ten years ago; and yet I
never resume it without a feeling that it
may be the last time I shall ever go down.
Of course one has more confidence after a
while; but there is something in being shut
up in an armor weighed down with a hundred
pounds, and knowing that a little leak
in your life-pipe is your death, that no diver
can get rid of. And I do not know that I
should care to banish the feeling, for the
sight of the clear blue sky, the genial sun,
and the face of a fellow-man after long hours
among the fishes, makes you feel like one
who has suddenly been drawn away from
the grasp of death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you ever in great danger?&#8221; asked
Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the most dangerous place I ever
got into was going down to examine the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
propeller Comet, sunk off Toledo. In working
about her bottom, I got my air-pipe
coiled over a large sliver from the stoven
hole, and could not reach it with my hands.
Every time I sprang up to remove the hose,
my tender would give me the &#8216;slack&#8217; of the
line, thus letting me fall back again. He
did not understand his duties, and did not
know what my signals on the life-line meant.
It was two hours and a half before I was
relieved, and there was not a moment that I
was not looking to see the hose cut by the
ragged wood. It&#8217;s a strange feeling you
have down there. You go walking over a
vessel, clambering up her sides, peering here
and there, and the feeling that you are alone
makes you nervous and uneasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes a vessel sinks down so fairly,
that she stands up on the bottom as trim
and neat as if she rode upon the surface.
Then you can go down into the cabin, up
the shrouds, walk all over her, just as easy
as a sailor could if she were still dashing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
away before the breeze. Only it seems
quiet, so tomb-like; there are no waves
down there&mdash;only a swaying back and forth
of the waters, and a see-sawing of the ship.
You hear nothing from above. The great
fishes will come swimming about, rubbing
their noses against your glass, and staring
with a wonderful look into your eyes. The
very stillness sometimes gives life a chill.
You hear just a moaning, wailing sound,
like the last notes of an organ, and you cannot
help thinking of dead men floating over
and around you.</p>
<p>&#8220;A diver does not like to go down more
than a hundred and twenty feet; at that
depth the pressure is painful, and there is
danger of internal injury. I can stay down,
for five or six hours at a time, at a hundred
and fifteen or twenty feet, and do a good
deal of hard work. In the waters of Lake
Huron the diver can see thirty or forty feet
away, but the other lakes will screen a vessel
not ten feet from you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Up here you seldom think of accident or
death, but a hundred feet of water washing
over your head would set you to thinking.
A little stoppage of the air-pump, a leak in
your hose, a careless action on the part of
your tender, and a weight of a mountain
would press the life out of you before you
could make a move. And you may &#8216;foul&#8217;
your pipe or line yourself, and in your haste
bring on what you dread. I often get my
hose around a stair or rail, and generally
release it without much trouble; the bare
idea of what a slender thing holds back the
clutch of death off my throat makes a cold
sweat start from every pore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you find many beautiful
things,&#8221; said Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could describe half the wonderful
and beautiful things I find,&#8221; cried Mr.
Lacelle.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are flowers, the most exquisite
that can be imagined; groves of coral, beautiful
caverns, with floors of silver sand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
spiral caves winding down, down, down,
covered with beautiful, delicate plants, and
leading to beds of smooth, hard sand, which
shine like gold. Feathery ferns turn silver
and crimson beneath your hand, and beautiful
fish glide around you, or rest in the
water, with no motion save the gentle pulsation
of their gills as they breathe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have stood upon the bottom of the ocean,
and gazed up, awe-stricken and bewildered,
at the wonderful masses of coral above my
head, resembling forests of monstrous trees,
with gnarled and twisted branches intertwined;
and when I have considered that it
was all the work of insects so tiny that
millions of them were working at my feet,
and I could not see them, I have compared
my own littleness in the universe with the
wonderful work of the least of them, and
have felt my own insignificance.</p>
<p>&#8220;And curious things have happened, too.
I was once examining an old wreck off
South America. It was an old Spanish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
frigate, supposed to have valuable jewels
and a large amount of money aboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was walking over the wreck one day,
and, being disappointed in not finding any
treasure, was about returning, when I observed
a curious heap of shells, close to one
of the stanchions. I picked off a handful
from the top of the heap, which was about
two feet high, and regularly piled in a conical
form, and seeing the shells were of a most
beautiful pink color, and very delicate, I filled
my pockets with them, and then, touching the
life-lines, was pulled up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The divers in my employ were delighted
with them, and as they were just the right size
for buttons, one of the boys went down, with
a large bag, to bring off the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him just where to find them; but
when he came up, he declared there were
none to be seen anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sure he had not followed my directions;
so I went down again; and judge my
surprise when I found he had spoken truly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
<i>There was not one to be seen.</i> The little
wretches, disgusted with the disturbance I
created, had all crawled away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How curious!&#8221; exclaimed Eric. &#8220;Could
you not find any of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a vestige of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was singular&mdash;wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I have learned many singular
things since I have gone under the sea. For
instance, water is a very powerful conductor
of sound, much more so than air. We often
blast rocks under the water&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you?&#8221; interrupted Eric. &#8220;What
keeps the powder dry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have water-proof charges prepared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can you fire them under the
water?&#8221; persisted Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;By electricity,&#8221; responded Mr. Lacelle.
&#8220;A report of blasting rock a little distance
off, will scarcely disturb us upon the land;
but under the water it is very different. We
were once blasting rocks near the coast, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
another party were at work three quarters of
a mile from us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our charge was set, and ready to go off;
I sent word to our distant neighbors that we
were about to blast, and they had better come
up until it was over. My courtesy was repaid
by a very profane answer, accompanied
with a request to &#8216;blast away.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So the charge was set off; and the unfortunate
divers in the distance were hauled
out of the water more dead than alive. I
afterwards learned from them that the shock
was tremendous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you blow up the rocks, do you
place the charges under them?&#8221; inquired
Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, no; that would have no effect: holes
are drilled in the rock, and the charges
placed within them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when the rocks are blown, what do
you do with the pieces that come off?&#8221; asked
Eric.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We grapple them with hooks and chains,
and draw them to the surface.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very interesting, and I am very
much obliged to you for telling me so
much,&#8221; said Eric. &#8220;I wish I could learn
<i>all</i> about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my boy, you shall go with me to-morrow;
and, if you&#8217;re not afraid to venture,
I&#8217;ll take you down beneath the sea with me.
It is quite safe near Amsterdam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, thank you, sir,&#8221; said Eric, eagerly,
grasping the kind Frenchman&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go now to the palace,&#8221; said Mr.
Lacelle. &#8220;I have an engagement there.
Will you do me the honor to amuse yourself
here until I return?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Eric again, with a
joyous smile; for Mr. Lacelle&#8217;s room was
stored with &#8216;curios&#8217; from the bottom of the
sea, and Eric knew he could spend a long
time very comfortably there.</p>
<p>He was careful to secure Froll in her
cage, that she might do no mischief; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
then he had a thoroughly good time, examining
the sea things; and as they were all labelled
with name and date, and the place
from which they were taken, he gained much
useful information.</p>
<p>Before night a letter came from his uncle,
saying that Johnny was quite ill, and had
been unable to travel to the Hague; but he
was now so much better, that they would
probably join Eric in a day or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t mind waiting,&#8221; said Eric to himself;
&#8220;and there&#8217;s nothing now to prevent
my going to Amsterdam to-morrow; but I
wish uncle Charlie could be with me too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he remembered that he had been left
under the landlord&#8217;s care, and must obtain
his permission. So he sought him out, and
made known his request.</p>
<p>The landlord of the Vyverberg was a kind-hearted
German. He was quite fond of his
little American guest, and readily consented
to his plan for the morrow, telling Eric that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Monsieur Lacelle was a remarkable man, and
he could not be in better hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is just the jolliest country,
and full of the jolliest people in the world,&#8221;
was Eric&#8217;s mental comment before he fell
asleep that night. Indeed, there are few
people more kind-hearted, thoughtful, or
hospitable than the Dutch and Germans.</p>
<p>Eric&#8217;s parents were anxiously wondering
how their boy fared alone in Gravenhaag.</p>
<p>Could they have seen him as he read his
promised chapter, and knelt to commit himself
to God, or afterwards, falling asleep,
his last thought of the kindness of the people
around him, their own sleep would have been
far lighter, and their prayers would have
blessed the good foreigners.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THRILLING EXPERIENCE.</h3>
</div>

<p>Early in the morning they went to
Amsterdam, or Amsteldamme, as the
Germans call it, because it controls the tides
of the Amstel River.</p>
<p>The city of Amsteldamme is situated on a
marsh, and all its houses and buildings are
erected on piles, which are driven from forty
to fifty feet into the earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many canals!&#8221; was Eric&#8217;s first remark,
when he obtained a good view of the
city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Lacelle. &#8220;When I was a
boy, I counted the bridges across the canals,
and there were two hundred and fifty. The
city is divided by the canals into ninety
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
islands. Those high walls were once ramparts,
but have since been converted into
public walks. They are planted with trees,
and make excellent promenades.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose there should be another
war,&#8221; said Eric; &#8220;what would their defence
be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They could easily flood the surrounding
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What splendid streets these are!&#8221; said
Eric, as they passed through one and another
with rows of beautiful shade trees,
handsome little stone bridges, broad, clean
pavements, and long lines of elegant mansions.</p>
<p>They were indeed very beautiful streets,
not easily to be surpassed in all Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think,&#8221; said Eric, thoughtfully,
&#8220;that there would be danger to the people
here in having so much water in their town.
Do the dikes ever give way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very seldom. The people watch them
very faithfully, and whenever a break is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
discovered it is instantly repaired. There is
a very interesting story connected with the
dikes of Holland, which I will tell you, to
show you what great service a little boy did
his country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little hero, Peter Daik, was on his
way home, one night, from a village to
which he had been sent by his father on an
errand, when he noticed the water trickling
through a narrow opening in the dike, built
up to keep out the sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;He stopped, and thought of what would
happen if the hole were not closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He knew&mdash;for he had often heard his father
tell of the sad disasters which had come
from small beginnings&mdash;how, in a few hours,
the opening would become bigger, and let
in the mighty mass of water pressing on
the dike, until, the whole defence being
washed away, the rolling, dashing, angry
sea would sweep on to the next village, destroying
life and property, and everything in
its way. Should he run home and alarm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
the villagers? It would be dark before
they could arrive; and the hole, even
then, might be so large as to defy all
attempts to close it. What could he do
to prevent such terrible ruin&mdash;he, only a
little boy?</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell what he did. He sat down on
the bank of the canal, stopped the opening
with his hand, and patiently awaited the
passing of a villager. But no one came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hour after hour rolled slowly by; yet
there sat the heroic boy in the cold and darkness,
shivering, wet, and tired, but stoutly
pressing his hand against the water that
tried to pass the dangerous breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;All night he staid at his post. At last
morning broke, when a clergyman, walking
up the canal, heard a groan, and looking
around to see where it came from, seeing the
boy, and surprised at his strange position,
exclaimed with astonishment,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why are you there, my child?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am keeping back the water, sir, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
saving the village from being drowned,&#8217;
answered little Peter, with lips so benumbed
with cold that he could hardly speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;The astonished minister at once relieved
him of his hard duty, and the poor little
fellow had but just strength enough left to
alarm the villagers, who flocked to the dike,
and repaired the breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heroic boy! What a noble spirit of
self-devotion he had shown! resolving to
brave all the fatigue, the danger, the cold
and darkness, rather than permit the ruin
which would come if he deserted his post.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a beautiful poem on the subject
by Miss Carey. I will repeat a few of the
last verses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Lacelle repeated in a clear,
mellow voice, whose slight foreign accent
lent it an additional charm to Eric&#8217;s ear,&mdash;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>They had now come to the Y, an inlet of
the Zuyder Zee, where several of the men
under Mr. Lacelle were at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; said Eric, gladly. &#8220;Here
we are! Now for my &#8216;thrilling experience,&#8217;
as the newspapers say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>There was a tent close by, into which
they stepped to change their dress for the
diver&#8217;s costume.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody would know me now, I am
sure,&#8221; said Eric to himself, when, with
much difficulty, and considerable help from
the attendants, he emerged from the tent
arrayed in the suit. &#8220;I can hardly drag my
feet along, they are so heavy; and I&#8217;m decidedly
glad that my every-day hat is not
like this helmet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Lacelle had given him particular
directions about diving, and now the life-line
and air-hose were adjusted, and the
brave boy stood beside the professional diver,
waiting for the descent.</p>
<p>The signal was given, and soon Eric was
going down underneath the blue, cold waves.
He could not see Mr. Lacelle; it seemed as
if he were never to stop going down: the
water sang around his ears; and seeing
nothing but water made him giddy and
faint. He thought he must certainly smother,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
and, for an instant, was thoroughly
afraid.</p>
<p>Then he remembered that, at a single
touch of the life-line, the men above would
instantly draw him up, and, feeling quite
at his ease again, began to look about him.
To his great joy he saw the bottom, and
was presently upon it, and walking towards
Mr. Lacelle.</p>
<p>Suddenly a sound like heavy peals of
thunder reverberated through the water.
At a motion from Mr. Lacelle, Eric looked
quickly upward, and saw a school of tiny
fish, darting with great velocity towards
them, and several large fishes in pursuit of
the little ones.</p>
<p>On they came, straight towards Eric and
Mr. Lacelle; but just before reaching them,
they turned sharply off in the opposite
direction; as they turned, the noise increased
to a heavy peal, and ceased as they passed
from sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;How wonderful!&#8221; exclaimed Eric, involuntarily;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
and his voice sounded like roaring
and screaming, though he had spoken
quite softly.</p>
<p>Mr. Lacelle then held at arm&#8217;s length a
small cartridge, which he signalled, by the
lines, for the men above to ignite. Almost
instantly it exploded. Eric was perfectly
astounded by the effects of the report.</p>
<p>It seemed as if huge rocks had fallen upon
his helmet; and such a crashing, rending
sound as accompanied the shock! It was
quite as much as he was able to bear in the
way of noise. Mr. Lacelle told him afterwards,
that the noise of the report in the
air would be no louder than that of a common
fire-cracker.</p>
<p>Eric hoped that Mr. Lacelle would make
no more experiments in sound, and the diver
did not seem at all anxious to do so.</p>
<p>It was rather awe-inspiring, Eric thought,
to be walking easily about at the bottom of
the sea, knowing that around and above
him lay the mighty element of death. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
there, under the water, the eighth psalm
came into his mind, and he realized its beauty
as he had never been able to before.</p>
<p>He walked around, picking up shells and
curious plants, and being careful to keep
near Mr. Lacelle, who was making some
calculations about the building of a huge
bridge, contemplated by the king. Several
large fish swam lazily up to Eric, eyed him
curiously, and let themselves be patted upon
the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;How amused Nettie would be!&#8221; he
thought, and wished the huge fish were less
inquisitive, as he did not particularly fancy
them. He was quite interested in the flowers,
which were as brilliant and beautiful as any
upon the land, when suddenly he discovered
a heap of shells quite similar to those which
Mr. Lacelle had described the day before.
He put several handfuls of them into his
diver&#8217;s basket, and then, moving off a few
steps, he watched to see what they would do.</p>
<p>When all was quiet, they moved slowly at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
first, then more rapidly, and all crawled
away in the same direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is very curious,&#8221; thought Eric to
himself. &#8220;I wish I knew what they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he moved again, something struck
his foot. Looking quickly down through
the window in his helmet, he saw a small,
square box, made of tin, and fastened with a
padlock. A key was in the lock, and Eric
turned it and opened the box, wondering
what it could contain. The lid flew back,
and disclosed an inner cover, on which was
painted a coat of arms, with the name &#8220;Arthur
Montgomery&#8221; engraved beneath. A
spring was visible, and, pressing it, Eric disclosed
to his astonished vision a number of
English sovereigns&mdash;gold coins worth about
five dollars apiece.</p>
<p>His first impulse was to show the prize to
Mr. Lacelle, but he could not readily attract
his attention. So, putting the box in his
basket after safely locking it, he busied himself
with gathering the beautiful flowers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
within his reach, and storing them in his
basket to press for his mother.</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt himself being drawn up
slowly towards the surface, and, turning his
head, saw that Mr. Lacelle was also ascending.</p>
<p>He knew that they were being drawn up
because Mr. Lacelle wished him to catch the
return train to Gravenhaag, and had cautioned
the men at the pumps not to let them remain
under water more than half an hour;
but he was extremely surprised to find that
the time had passed.</p>
<p>On reaching &#8220;terra firma,&#8221; so much
hurrying had to be done in changing his
armor for more convenient land apparel, that
he entirely forgot the box of money until
seated beside Mr. Lacelle in the carriage.
Then he showed it to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That <i>was</i> a find, for so young a submarinist,&#8221;
said Mr. Lacelle. &#8220;It is yours,
my boy; divers consider themselves entitled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
to all such unexpectedly discovered valuables.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Eric, eagerly, &#8220;the owner&#8217;s
name is upon the box; and see! here is a
letter addressed to &#8216;Arthur Montgomery,
Bart., Clone, Lancaster County, England.&#8217;
I think I ought to return it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Lacelle, pleased with
Eric&#8217;s honesty, &#8220;conscientiously you ought;
but you are not obliged to by law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would much rather,&#8221; said Eric, earnestly.
&#8220;Will you please to inquire about it,
and see that it reaches the owner?&#8221; Mr.
Lacelle promised, and, seeing Eric safely
aboard the cars, bade him good by, and left
for Amsteldamme.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>UNCLE JOHN.</h3>
</div>

<p>When Eric returned to Gravenhaag,
whom should he see but his uncle,
Mr. Van Rasseulger? And he being the last
person in the world that Eric would have
thought of meeting there, of course he was
decidedly surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle John!&#8221; he exclaimed, joyfully.
&#8220;Who would have thought of seeing you
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll wager, young man, or
you&#8217;d not have gone wild goosing it over the
water at Amsterdam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a glorious time!&#8221; exclaimed
Eric. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been walking upon the bottom
of the Zuyder Zee.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s high time somebody arrived to look
after you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, uncle John, it was perfectly safe.
Mr. Lacelle is an experienced diver; and
the landlord under whose care papa left me
gave me permission. Besides, nothing happened&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How stout and healthy you have grown!&#8221;
exclaimed Mr. Van Rasseulger, interrupting
Eric. &#8220;If Johnny has improved as much
as you have, I shall send him abroad frequently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is Johnny? He was ill when uncle
Charlie wrote to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ill!&#8221; exclaimed Johnny&#8217;s fond papa, instantly
growing anxious. &#8220;What did the
doctor say, Eric?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that I must wait here a day or two,
until Johnny was well enough to come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where were they when he wrote?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At Paris,&#8221; said Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant to stay with you to-night,&#8221; said
his uncle; &#8220;but I believe I shall take the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
boat to Antwerp to-night, and catch the Express
to Paris. I must look after my boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, please take me with you,&#8221; pleaded
Eric. &#8220;Mr. Lacelle is going to stay at Amsterdam,
and I shall be terribly lonesome
here, all alone again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, get your things together. Can
you be ready in two hours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In ten minutes,&#8221; cried Eric, gayly:
&#8220;mamma did all my packing before she left.
I&#8217;ve only to tumble a few things into my
travelling-bag, and to feed myself and Froll.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The little monkey? I&#8217;ve made her acquaintance.
We&#8217;re quite good friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle John, if you haven&#8217;t seen the doctor
or Johnny, how <i>did</i> you find me?&#8221; said
Eric, who had been puzzling himself with
this question for some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely by accident,&#8221; replied his uncle.
&#8220;I arrived here about two hours since, and,
finding all your names on the register, supposed
I had stepped right into a family party;
but then I learned that your father and mother,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
and that bundle of mischief called Nettie,
had gone home, and that <i>Mynheer</i> Eric had
gone to Amsteldamme to explore the mysteries
of the bottom of the sea. I was so
frightened that if there had been a chance
of hitting you, I should have gone directly
after you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you had,&#8221; said Eric, &#8220;in time to
have gone down into the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Van Rasseulger, for all his talk about
Eric&#8217;s expedition, was heartily pleased with
his brave little nephew, and was thinking to
himself such an honest, energetic, courageous
boy would make his way well in the world.</p>
<p>Eric had no idea that he was a particularly
interesting boy. He was large and strong
for his age, easy in his manners, and had
a frank, joyous countenance, surmounted
by thick, brown, curly hair. His eyes were
very honest eyes indeed, often opening wide
in a surprised way, when they saw anything
not quite right, and blazing and flashing upon
the aggressor when they witnessed wrong,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
cruelty, or injustice. He had been brought
up upon the creed, &#8220;First of all, <i>do right</i>;
and <i>be a gentleman</i>.&#8221; And being thoughtful,
careful, and obedient, he was trusted
and respected as few boys of his age rarely
deserve to be.</p>
<p>Of course he had his faults. No young
lad is without them. But the difference
between Eric and other boys was, that when
he became conscious of a fault in his character,
he immediately set about overcoming it,
and therefore soon got rid of it. But he was
obliged to keep a very careful watch over
himself, for little faults creep into one&#8217;s character
faster than the little weeds spring up in
the flower garden, and, like the weeds, too,
if at once removed are almost harmless, but
if allowed to spread and flourish they soon
spoil the entire character, as the weeds spoil
the garden.</p>
<p>While we have been moralizing, Eric has
eaten his supper, neatly packed up the few
things left about, and, with Froll and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
travelling-bag, starts from the Vyverberg for
Paris.</p>
<p>A very common-looking steamboat took
them to Antwerp. There is not much to relate
of their journey, for Eric&#8217;s adventures
had so tired him that he slept all the way,
only awakening to take the cars at Antwerp,
and rousing once again to know they were
passing through Brussels, and to hear his
uncle say that the finest altar in the world
was in the cathedral there. They arrived at
Paris about noon of the next day, and, after
considerable trouble, found that Dr. Ward
had taken rooms in a hotel in the <i>Place
Vendôme</i>, whither they at once repaired.</p>
<p>Eric wanted to give his uncle and cousin
a surprise. So Mr. Van Rasseulger did not
send up their names, but they stole softly up
the stairs, and opened the door.</p>
<p>Johnny was alone, lying upon the floor,
with a very fretful, discontented expression
upon his countenance.</p>
<p>He turned his head towards the door, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
there, upon the threshold, blushing and laughing,
stood Eric; and, better still, behind
him was papa. The child uttered a joyful
cry, and sprang into his father&#8217;s arms, who
hurried to meet him, exclaiming,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy, my Johnny-boy, what is the
matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only the mumps,&#8221; said Johnny, reassuringly,
and holding out his hand to Eric.
&#8220;O, ain&#8217;t I glad you&#8217;ve come!&#8221; he added.
&#8220;It&#8217;s awful dull here, uncle Charlie is away
at the hospital so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how have you been, excepting the
mumps?&#8221; inquired his father, relieved enough
to find nothing serious the matter with his
petted boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; exclaimed John, very improperly.
&#8220;See how strong I&#8217;m getting, papa!&#8221;
and he threw out his fist suddenly, giving his
father a very uncomfortable punch in the side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t illustrate on me,&#8221;
said Eric, laughing. &#8220;Uncle John, are you
a tester?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an <i>at</i>testor, certainly,&#8221; replied his
uncle. &#8220;Johnny, if you demonstrate your
power of strength so forcibly and practically,
some one will apply oil of birch to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be in first-rate running order,&#8221;
retorted Johnny, &#8220;and you&#8217;ll have to take
me to Strasbourg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;I think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they all sat, merrily talking, Dr.
Ward returned, and was pleased and surprised
enough to find his unexpected guests.
His greeting was very cordial.</p>
<p>Eric he was particularly glad to see; he
had been worried about leaving him so long,
alone, at the Hague; and Johnny had been
too ill to travel or to be left with strangers,
and Eric was too inexperienced, his uncle
thought, to go from the Hague to Paris
alone. So it was quite a relief to find him
safely at hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he said, after talking about
home affairs for quite a while, &#8220;I see my way
out of a dilemma. I have been anxious to attend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
two or three medical lectures at Heidelberg,
and if you will look after the boys for
a day or two, I can have my desire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly; I will for a day or two. At
the end of that time I must go home.
Here&#8217;s this dutiful boy of mine, with never
a word for mamma, Annie, or Adolphe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Johnny, remonstrating, &#8220;you
took me so by surprise, papa, that I forgot
all about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your filial affection must be strong,&#8221;
said his father, laughing at him.</p>
<p>Johnny did not like this, and proposed to
Eric to take a walk, and &#8220;see Paris.&#8221;</p>
<p>While they were gone, Mr. Van Rasseulger
arranged with the doctor to meet them
again at Heidelberg; meanwhile he would
keep the boys with him for a week. They
would leave Paris the next day, if John was
well enough.</p>
<p>Dr. Ward thought he would be.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Rasseulger explained that he
had been obliged to visit Rotterdam and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
Hague suddenly on business, and must go
to Vienna, in Austria, and start for home,
within a fortnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t neglect to take the boy to Munich,
and show him to his grandfather; and don&#8217;t
forget your promise to &#8216;make him as hearty
and strong as Eric,&#8217;&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Poor little Johnny, in the interval between
his own birth and that of his baby brother,&mdash;a
space of seven years,&mdash;had been petted
and pampered, and almost thoroughly spoiled.
His temper had suffered with his constitution,
and he became a delicate, sickly child.
His parents, while living in New York, had
lost three boys, and fearing to lose Johnny,
too, had sent him to travel abroad, under
Dr. Ward&#8217;s care. Mr. Van Rasseulger was
a native of Germany, and thought there was
no air so invigorating as that breathed in on
German soil. He had great hopes of its
curing John&#8217;s delicacy; and Dr. Ward
thought that a strange country and traveller&#8217;s
hardships would be excellent aids in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
restoring the boy&#8217;s natural health and good-nature.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Eric was seeing Paris under
Johnny&#8217;s guidance. To be sure, he could
not see much in a day; but he took a look
at the war column in the <i>Place Vendôme</i>,
saw the <i>Palace of the Tuileries</i>, the <i>Jardin
des Plantes</i>, and entertained his little cousin
with an account of his visit to the King of
Holland, and his submarine diving, both
of which Johnny thought very wonderful.
Eric was not much concerned at seeing so
little of Paris at the time, for he knew that
the doctor intended to spend a month there,
after visiting Munich. He bought a guide-book
while out with Johnny, and then they
returned to their rooms in time to see the
doctor start for Heidelberg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eric,&#8221; said Johnny, when Dr. Ward had
gone, &#8220;I must show you the American railway
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said Eric; &#8220;I&#8217;m sure that is the
last thing I came to Paris to see.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Johnny, importantly, &#8220;I
suppose you think you know just what it is;
but you&#8217;re quite as mistaken as if you were
a donkey without ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John!&#8221; said his father, reprovingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was only a &#8216;simile,&#8217; papa,&#8221; answered
Johnny, roguishly, as he led Eric
out again.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when they reached the railway,
Eric found that his idea of it had been
far from correct.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing at all but an omnibus running
upon rails,&#8221; he said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why
they call it American.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t anything like as nice as our street
cars&mdash;is it?&#8221; answered Johnny, with a flourish
of national pride quite pardonable in so
young an American.</p>
<p>Just then the conductor, supposing the
two boys wished to be passengers, saluted
them politely, exclaiming, &#8220;<i>Complete, complete!</i>&#8221;
and the omnibus rolled off along the
rails.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What did he mean?&#8221; asked Eric, quite
puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said the coach was full,&#8221; Johnny
replied. &#8220;They are never allowed to carry
more passengers than there are seats for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is still less and less like an American
railway,&#8221; said Eric, laughing, and thinking
of the crowded cars and overstrained
horses he had so often seen and pitied,
wearily perambulating the streets of New
York.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have some cake and coffee,&#8221; Johnny
proposed, as they were strolling towards
home. &#8220;I think French coffee is hard to
beat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was your age,&#8221; remarked Eric,
&#8220;mamma almost decided to live in Paris;
but I am very glad she did not, for I think
New York a great deal nicer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny led the way to a café&mdash;that is, a
coffee-house,&mdash;and here they regaled themselves
with rolls and delicious coffee.</p>
<p>Eric was shocked to see Johnny appropriate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
a couple of cakes and two lumps of
sugar, left over from their repast, and convey
them to his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Johnny!&#8221; he exclaimed, in a tone
of mortification.</p>
<p>&#8220;They all do so,&#8221; said John, laughing. &#8220;A
Frenchman thinks he has a right to everything
that he pays for. Watch the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric looked around and saw several
Frenchmen, who had finished their lunch,
following John&#8217;s example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if I should do that at
Millard&#8217;s, how they <i>would</i> all stare!&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnny was quite pleased with his own
importance in being able to show Eric
around the city, and proposed several places
that they &#8220;ought to see.&#8221; But the afternoon
was waning, and a damp, chilly breeze sprang
up, which Eric knew, from experience, was
not at all good for the mumps. So he very
prudently hurried Johnny home, holding
forth Froll&#8217;s loneliness as an additional inducement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>STRASBOURG.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Uncle John,&#8221; said Eric, the next
morning, &#8220;do you think of going
through Strasbourg, when we leave for Munich?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said his uncle; &#8220;I have business to
attend to on another route.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, papa,&#8221; expostulated Johnny, &#8220;we
want to see the great clock in the Strasbourg
Cathedral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be impossible for me to go,&#8221; Mr.
Van Rasseulger said, very decidedly; but
seeing that both the boys were greatly disappointed,
he added, &#8220;If you could be a sober
boy, Johnny, I might trust you alone with
Eric, and you might go to Switzerland by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
the Strasbourg route, meeting me at Lucerne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By ourselves? O, how jolly!&#8221; Johnny
exclaimed, turning a somersault upon the
floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the question is, my boy, <i>Can</i> I trust
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, papa!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will consider it, John. I can trust Eric,
but your inclinations are apt to be rather unsteady.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was certainly true, for Johnny&#8217;s inclination
just then was, back parallel with
the floor, heels at a right angle with his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think I will try you,&#8221; continued his
father. &#8220;I shall put you under Eric&#8217;s care,
and require you to obey and refer to him.
You may start to-morrow morning, which
will give you time to spend a day and night
at Strasbourg, and to meet me at Lucerne,
on the evening of the day after to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! hurrah!&#8221; screamed Johnny,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
leaping to his feet, &#8220;hurrah for Strasbourg and
its wonderful clock! Three cheers for&mdash;Good
gracious!&#8221;</p>
<p>The excited boy&#8217;s exuberant spirits went
up with Eric&#8217;s guide-book to the ceiling of
the room, and returned in bewilderment as
the unfortunate book came down in a basin
of water in which he had been sailing his
magnetic ship.</p>
<p>&#8220;An encouraging beginning that,&#8221; remarked
his father, gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to, Eric,&#8221; Johnny said
quite meekly; &#8220;I guess &#8216;twill dry in the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you had better put it there,&#8221; said
Mr. Van Rasseulger; &#8220;you are tearing the
leaves by holding the book in your wet
hands.&#8221; Johnny spread the guide-book upon
a sunny window-seat, listening with interest
to Eric&#8217;s proposal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must study the route on the map down
stairs; and if you are willing, uncle John, I
will go out now with Johnny and get the
tickets.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said his uncle; &#8220;but my advice
would be to study a dry guide-book and
the map before getting the tickets; there may
be a choice of routes.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was excellent advice, as the boys
soon found. There were three routes, and
some time elapsed before they decided upon
one.</p>
<p>At length they chose the shortest of all,
as their time was limited and they wanted it
all for Strasbourg. Their choice, therefore,
fell upon the most direct route, it being
straight across the country of France, and
for a distance of about two hundred and fifty
miles traversed by rail.</p>
<p>They consulted with Monsieur Richarte,
the landlord, and their uncle, and decided to
take an early train on the following morning.
A ride of eight hours would suffice for the
journey, and their early start would enable
them to have a few hours for sight-seeing in
the day and twilight.</p>
<p>But tourists should always allow for detention.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
For although Mr. Van Rasseulger saw
them safely aboard the early train in the
morning, an accident detained them at Vitry,
and when they reached Strasbourg it was night&mdash;a
dark, rainy, dismal night.</p>
<p>They rode directly to the principal hotel,
a large, roomy, comfortable-looking place,
and immediately after supper proceeded to
their room for the night.</p>
<p>Before retiring, Johnny looked out from
between the crimson window curtains, to see
what he could of the city; but little was visible.
Opposite the window was a little two-story
house, with queer stagings about the
chimneys. He called Eric to look at them,
saying he guessed the chimneys were being
rebuilt.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Johnny,&#8221; said Eric. &#8220;You will find
those stagings upon almost every house here.
They are erected by the house-owners for the
especial accommodation of storks that build in
the chimneys and are the street scavengers of
Strasbourg.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are they?&#8221; said Johnny, sleepily; &#8220;well,
let&#8217;s go to bed.&#8221; They were both very tired
and sleepy boys, and prepared for a good
night&#8217;s rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I shall sleep well,&#8221; Johnny remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m sure I shall,&#8221; said Eric. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
travelled nearly six hundred miles since night
before last.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they were destined to disappointment,
for from the large, open fireplace in the
room there issued, all night long, a continuous
wailing, moaning, rustling sound, caused
by the wind; added to which were the dismal
groanings of the old storks and piping of the
young ones.</p>
<p>It seemed to Eric that he had but just
fallen asleep, when Johnny was shaking him
and hallooing in his ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eric! Eric! it&#8217;s a splendid morning!
Get up quick. I want to go out and see the
sights. Hurry up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Eric.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>Johnny scampered down stairs, and before
long Eric joined him in the hall, where the
impatient boy was walking on his hands, with
his heels in the air, by way of diversion.</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready?&#8221; he cried, and resumed a position
more convenient and becoming for a
promenade, as they started.</p>
<p>They had a fine, breezy walk.</p>
<p>Strasbourg is not far from the Rhine; and
one of its tributaries, the graceful, sparkling
<i>Ill</i> River, which, as Johnny suggested, is a
very <i>good</i> stream, washes the city&#8217;s walls and
supplies it with water.</p>
<p>This city is famous for its immense fortifications,
its Minster, or Cathedral, and the
Astronomical Clock of the Three Sages.</p>
<p>Its form is triangular, and the entire city
is enclosed by a bastioned line of ramparts
and several outworks.</p>
<p>There are seven entrance gates, and on the
east side is a strong pentagonal or five-sided
tower.</p>
<p>There is a network of sluices, by which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
the surrounding country can be inundated.
Strasbourg is one of the most important fortresses
and arsenals of France, besides being
its principal depot of artillery. It is pleasantly
situated, but most of its streets are
narrow, with lofty eaves-drooping houses.</p>
<p>The boys were surprised to hear its inhabitants
speaking German instead of French,
but learned that the town was originally
German, and was ceded to France in one of
the Louis XIV. wars, when it became the
capital of <i>Bas Rhin</i>, a division of France,
on the eastern frontier.</p>
<p>In many of the streets of Strasbourg are
little wooden bridges, similar to canal bridges.
These are built over the Ill, which intersects
the city in all directions.</p>
<p>When Eric and Johnny took their stroll, it
was market-day, and, even at that early hour,
the streets presented a lively scene.</p>
<p>Carts and drays were the stalls in the open
street, and people were buying and selling
at a great rate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>The fish stalls were surrounded by storks;
but the people seemed to mind them no more
than the birds minded the people. These
storks are great favorites with Germans. In
Strasbourg they are as tame as our domestic
hens, and it is very comical to see them strutting
importantly about, as if they had as good
a right to the sidewalk as the other citizens.</p>
<p>The boys returned to the hotel with ravenous
appetites, but, hungry as they were,
could not appreciate the described daintiness
of a most apparently unpalatable pie, called
<i>pâté de foie gras</i>; so they were obliged to
content themselves with other edibles and fragrant
French coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the minster!&#8221; said Eric, as they
arose from the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>minister</i>?&#8221; exclaimed Johnny;
&#8220;what for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not <i>minister</i>, but <i>minster</i>. A minster
is a cathedral church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care much about the minster,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
then,&#8221; said Johnny, running up stairs on all
fours. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen cathedrals till I&#8217;m sick of
them. But this clock <i>is</i> curious, and I&#8217;m
anxious to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnny,&#8221; expostulated Eric, &#8220;walk properly.
You ought to have been a monkey.&mdash;And
that reminds me,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I
must feed Froll and fasten her, that she may
do no mischief while we&#8217;re at the cathedral.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Froll received an ample breakfast,
and her silver chain was securely fastened.
Then the boys left her.</p>
<p>When they had been gone a while, and
her breakfast had disappeared, Froll became
lonesome, and cast her eyes about to see with
what mischief she might best employ herself.
But thoughtful Eric had placed every temptation
out of her reach.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Eric and Johnny were viewing
the wonders of the famous astronomical
clock.</p>
<p>This clock is in the Strasbourg Cathedral.
It was built in the cathedral, before its completion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
in the year 1439, and was invented
by Isaac Habrecht, a Jewish astrologer.</p>
<p>European clocks were first invented in the
eleventh century, by the Saracens, and used
principally for monasteries. They were very
rude, simple affairs, and sometimes would
only &#8220;go&#8221; when somebody pushed the pendulum,
which was rather inconvenient than
otherwise.</p>
<p>So wise mathematicians tried to make
improvements; and some succeeded, among
whom was Isaac Habrecht, who, in the fourteenth
century, invented the most wonderful
clock in the world, and called it the &#8220;Clock
of the Three Sages,&#8221; because once in every
hour the figures of the Three Kings of the
Orient came out from a niche in its side, and
made a reverential bow before an image of
the Virgin Mary, seated just above the dial-plate,
on the front of the clock.</p>
<p>It is built of dark wood, gilded and carved,
and is sixty feet high. In shape it is somewhat
similar to a church, with a tower on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
either side of the entrance; and these towers
of the clock are encircled by spiral staircases,
which are used when repairs are necessary.</p>
<p>When Isaac Habrecht invented this wonderful
clock, he meant it to run forever,
always displaying to the good people of
Strasbourg the days of the month, places of
the sun and moon, and other celestial phenomena;
and while he lived it worked admirably:
but when he had been dead a while, the clock
stopped; and as nobody else understood its
machinery, it had quite a vacation.</p>
<p>After a while, however, the good people
of Strasbourg took it in hand, and it was
repaired and set going&mdash;only to stop again.
Thus it went on until Napoleon&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>Strasbourg, originally a German town, was
ceded to Louis XIV. in 1681; so the clock
was French property, and Napoleon decided
it must be brought to life again. Under the
most skilful French and German machinists
this repairing took place. It was eminently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
successful <i>this</i> time, and, when completed,
was a great improvement on the old clock.</p>
<p>It will now give not only the time of
Strasbourg, but of every principal city in the
world; also the day of the week and month,
the course of the sun and planets, and all the
eclipses of the sun and moon, in their regular
order.</p>
<p>In an alcove, above the dial, is an image
of the Saviour; and every day, at noon,
figures of the twelve apostles march round it
and bow, while the holy image, with uplifted
hands, administers a silent blessing. A cock,
on the highest point of the right hand tower,
flaps his wings and crows three times; and
when he stops, a beautiful chime of bells
rings out familiar and very musical tunes.</p>
<p>A figure of Time, in a niche on one side,
strikes the quarter hours from twelve to one;
and four figures&mdash;Childhood, Youth, Manhood,
and Old Age&mdash;pass slowly before
him. In a niche, on the other side is an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
angel turning an hour-glass. The clock is
in the south transept of the cathedral.</p>
<p>Persons travelling abroad usually take
Strasbourg on their route, to visit its cathedral,&mdash;the
spire of which is the highest in
the world, being four hundred and sixty
feet high,&mdash;and to see its wonderful astronomical
clock.</p>
<p>Eric and Johnny were very much pleased
with the famous clock. The guide who explained
and told its history to them was
very good-natured, and even allowed them
to ascend the tower of the cathedral, which,
usually, is not allowable.</p>
<p>Here they had a most magnificent view,
which I cannot attempt to describe, and only
advise you to go and see it for yourself.</p>
<p>Before leaving the cathedral, they bought
two photographs of the wonderful clock, intending
to send them home, with a description
of their visit to Strasbourg.</p>
<p>By the time their explorations were finished,
Johnny declared that he was so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
hungry, he could almost eat one of those
goose pies. The morning was quite gone.
It would soon be time to take the train for
Lucerne, and they must have dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t Froll be glad to see us back!&#8221;
exclaimed Johnny, as they reached their
room; &#8220;she doesn&#8217;t like to be left alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric had bought some nuts for the little
creature, and went with them straightway
to her cage.</p>
<p>The cage was just as he left it; the silver
chain was there, too, fastened to one of the
bars and to the tiny collar; but the collar
hung dangling at the end of the chain, and
Froll was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>ERIC IN TROUBLE.</h3>
</div>

<p>A thorough search was instantly
made; but neither around the room,
nor behind the furniture, nor upon the gallery
roof, were any traces to be found of the
lost Frolic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad,&#8221; cried Eric, in perplexity,
while Johnny looked ready to cry. &#8220;We
must speak to the landlord, and ask him
what we are to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric&#8217;s German was by no means perfect;
but he managed to make the good-natured
landlord understand their trouble. He made
inquiries of all, directly; but no one had
seen the little monkey since the boys had
left her. He did not think it at all likely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
that she had been stolen, for no one could
get to the boys&#8217; room without being noticed
by some of the servants, and he was quite
sure that she would return safely to her
comfortable quarters; so he advised the boys
to leave the window open for her, and to go
at once to the dinner he had been for some
time keeping for them.</p>
<p>His sensible advice was unwillingly followed;
but Froll took no advantage of the
window left open for her benefit.</p>
<p>Eric and Johnny waited and watched impatiently,
until it was almost time to start
for the train. Then Eric left directions with
the landlord, in case the monkey should be
found and captured; promising to send for
her. He was just going to call Johnny,
when he heard his voice, crying, excitedly,
&#8220;Eric, Eric!&#8221; and hoping Froll had returned,
ran quickly up the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;See there, what I found on the floor,&#8221;
exclaimed Johnny, as he entered the room,
and held up before Eric&#8217;s astonished gaze a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
jewelled ring, that flashed and sparkled in
the sunlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; exclaimed Eric; &#8220;on
the floor of <i>this</i> room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Johnny, &#8220;on the floor,
just where you&#8217;re standing. It&#8217;s a mercy we
haven&#8217;t stepped on it. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must find the owner at once. Isn&#8217;t
it splendid!&#8221; said Eric, admiringly; &#8220;three
diamonds and an emerald; it must have cost
a fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just at this juncture the door opened, and
the landlord, followed by a French officer
and a civilian, entered the room. The landlord
exclaimed, in German,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, young gentlemen,
but a serious loss has occurred in the house,
and as you are about leaving it, perhaps you
will be kind enough to let us inspect&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ah! mon Dieu! il y ait!</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> screamed
the French civilian, darting towards Eric
and John, and, snatching the ring from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
Johnny&#8217;s hand, displayed it triumphantly
before the landlord and the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found it on the floor,&#8221; said Johnny.
&#8220;Is it yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A likely story!&#8221; muttered the Frenchman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad you&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; said Eric,
with dignity. &#8220;My cousin found it on the
floor a minute ago, and we were on the
point of taking it to the landlord when you
came in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric spoke slowly and distinctly, and with
an air of honest truth that at once convinced
the landlord. But the excitable
little Frenchman, who had been clasping
the precious ring, and murmuring, &#8220;<i>Ciel,
ciel! ah, ciel!</i>&#8221; in an incoherent way, now
sprang at Eric, and grasping him by the
collar, exclaimed, angrily, &#8220;O, you fine
fellow! you wicked one! where is my&mdash;my
gold?&mdash;my gold? where is it?&#8221; and he gave
the boy a series of shakes.</p>
<p>Eric&#8217;s anger was fully aroused. With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
flashing eyes, &#8220;How dare you!&#8221; he said,
indignantly, and, turning upon the Frenchman,
flung him with some violence against
the wall.</p>
<p>This made the little Frenchman still more
furious; he would have sprung again upon
Eric, but the officer interfered. Johnny,
with his eyes almost starting from his head,
had terrifiedly regarded this little scene,
doubling his fists to aid in Eric&#8217;s rescue.</p>
<p>Eric turned indignantly to the landlord,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of all this? Are
two defenceless American boys, your guests,
to be openly insulted in your presence without
protection?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Count D&#8217;Orsay has been robbed of his
diamond ring and a sum of money,&#8221; explained
the landlord. &#8220;He insisted that no
person should leave the hotel without examination.
That is why we came to you.
He has found the ring in your hands, which
is very astonishing, and he now suspects you
of having the gold.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>The landlord spoke gently, and seemed
grieved to be obliged to hurt their feelings,
as he knew his implied meaning must.</p>
<p>Poor Eric&#8217;s face flushed hotly with shame
and anger, while Johnny cried, furiously,
&#8220;Eric, Eric, for pity&#8217;s sake send for papa!
He will teach that hateful Frenchman what
it is to call us thieves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet, John!&#8221; said Eric, imperiously.
&#8220;Come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, sir,&#8221; turning to the landlord,
&#8220;please to let your officer search us, and
then our baggage. Do it at once, for we
are to leave Strasbourg directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; sneered Count D&#8217;Orsay. &#8220;Perhaps
you will not leave Strasbourg for the
present. Search them, officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The officer advanced reluctantly, and, by
his expression of sympathy, showed himself
much more a gentleman than the titled count,
whose habitual politeness had been driven
away by Eric&#8217;s powerful thrust.</p>
<p>The landlord, although deeply sympathetic,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
and convinced of their honesty, was powerless
to resist Count D&#8217;Orsay. He was a German
innholder, and the count a wealthy, influential
French nobleman, with a proper warrant
for searching his house. So he could
in no way protect the boys from the indignity
put upon them. But he hailed with
joy Johnny&#8217;s suggestion to send for his father,
deciding to do so at once, if they should
be detained.</p>
<p>Of course no gold was found upon either
of them, except that given to Eric for tickets
and hotel expenses, and none was found in
their baggage.</p>
<p>But just as they were preparing to leave
the place, having been released by the officer,
Count D&#8217;Orsay uttered an exclamation, and
pointed to a <i>fauteuil</i>&mdash;an easy chair&mdash;by
the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Celui-là!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The officer stepped to the chair, and found,
tucked between the cushion and the arm, a
silk purse, full of gold pieces.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>Eric and Johnny were horror-stricken, and
the good landlord was dumb with astonishment.</p>
<p>The French count held up the purse triumphantly,
and jingled the gold before Eric&#8217;s
eyes, exclaiming, tauntingly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is mine, and I have it. The <i>prison</i>
is yours, and you shall have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eric, Eric,&#8221; cried Johnny, in agony of
terror, &#8220;they <i>can&#8217;t</i> send us to prison. We
haven&#8217;t done anything. We didn&#8217;t know the
money was there, or the ring. O, what shall
we do? Send for papa!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric&#8217;s face was very white, and his hand
trembled visibly, as he wrote his uncle&#8217;s address
on a card, and requested the landlord
to send for him.</p>
<p>Count D&#8217;Orsay wished them to be at once
conducted to prison: but this the landlord
would not allow, and the officer declared was
unnecessarily severe. They might remain in
their room, with a guard, and the landlord
would be responsible for their remaining.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>As soon as the detestable Frenchman had
gone, Johnny threw himself at full length
upon the floor, crying violently. Eric could
not comfort him, but sat at the window, with
a proud, defiant face and swelling heart.</p>
<p>Presently the kind landlord came again to
them.</p>
<p>He had sent word by telegraph to Johnny&#8217;s
father, and received a return message. Mr.
Van Rasseulger would be with them by
night.</p>
<p>This was comforting. And gradually the
boys thought less and less of their trouble,
and became quite interested in making conjectures
with the landlord as to when and
how the money and jewels came into their
room, and if Froll&#8217;s disappearance could be
owing to the same cause, or in any way connected
with it, and if she would probably
return at night.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an ill wind that blows nobody good,&#8221;
said Eric; &#8220;and perhaps, by being detained
here, we shall find her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what they do when papa
gets here,&#8221; said Johnny, whose faith in his
father&#8217;s power was limitless. &#8220;He&#8217;ll just
<i>fix</i> that Count D&#8217;Orsay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Van Rasseulger was whizzing
rapidly towards them in the afternoon
train, and another powerful friend was coming
from an opposite direction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>&#8220;A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED.&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>One, two, three, four, five, six, sounded
a deep-throated bell upon the evening
air, and then a chime of bells played Luther&#8217;s
Chant.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, dear!&#8221; groaned Johnny; &#8220;that&#8217;s the
wonderful clock; I wish we had let it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; exclaimed Eric.</p>
<p>His quick ear had caught the sound of
footsteps upon the stairway leading to their
room, and he fancied them to be his uncle&#8217;s.
He was right. The door opened presently,
and Mr. Van Rasseulger was with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is all this nonsense?&#8221; he
exclaimed, grasping Eric&#8217;s hand, and drawing
Johnny into his lap. &#8220;A good-natured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
guardian lets you off for a good time, and
you get into trouble the first thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric related all that had occurred, a little
embarrassed at Johnny&#8217;s admiring remark,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to have seen him spin that
little dancing Frenchman against the wall,
papa. I wish I&#8217;d been big enough! I&#8217;d
have thrashed him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Johnny,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;Go
on, Eric. You say he found the money in
the fauteuil. How in the world did the
things get into this room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just what puzzles everybody,&#8221; answered
Eric, earnestly. &#8220;Uncle John, how
<i>could</i> it have got there? and the ring, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you find the ring, Johnny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right here, sir, upon the floor, by Froll&#8217;s
cage;&#8221; answered Johnny, getting up and
standing in the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very mysterious, certainly,&#8221; Mr.
Van Rasseulger said, &#8220;and the strange circumstances
give the man strong grounds for
suspicion against you. Of course, it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
absurd to think that two little boys would
have committed such a robbery; yet the ring
was found in your hands, and the money
concealed in your room, and therefore you
are accused.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, papa, can&#8217;t you take us away? We
didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You silly boy, I <i>know</i> you did not do it.
But would you not rather stay and prove
satisfactorily to all that you did not? I
should not wish to take you from here while
the faintest shadow of a suspicion lingered
that you were guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor would I wish to go,&#8221; said Eric,
proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then we&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; said Johnny,
dolefully; &#8220;but I think it is dreadfully unjust
to spoil all our good time. We Americans
wouldn&#8217;t do so to a Frenchman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we would, under such suspicious
evidences,&#8221; said his uncle. &#8220;But you
needn&#8217;t worry about it, boys; every cloud has
a silver lining.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t pleasant to know we can&#8217;t go out
of our room,&#8221; said Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;No: I must arrange about that,&#8221; Mr.
Van Rasseulger answered. &#8220;I will write a
note to the American consul, and get you
released.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric started suddenly to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I heard Mr. Lacelle&#8217;s voice,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;You
left him at Amsterdam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, I know I did!&#8221; persisted Eric.
&#8220;There it is again: that is he! O, Uncle
John, go out and tell him about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His uncle left them, and before long returned,
actually bringing Mr. Lacelle with
him.</p>
<p>The diver was surprised beyond measure
to find his favorite Eric in Strasbourg, and
highly indignant at the circumstance which
detained him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the most honest boy that
ever lived,&#8221; he cried, and told Mr. Van
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Rasseulger about the box of sovereigns.
&#8220;But come, tell me all about this,&#8221; he
added.</p>
<p>Eric again related the incident, beginning
with his discovery of Froll&#8217;s disappearance,
and ending with the charge of theft and
threat of prison.</p>
<p>Johnny, who despite his dislike of Frenchmen
in general, cordially liked Mr. Lacelle,
was surprised to see his gradually increasing
excitement as Eric&#8217;s story progressed.
At its termination, he started to his feet,
and rapidly pacing the floor, exclaimed,
joyfully,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ha! a bon chat, bon rat!</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;What have cats and rats to do with it?&#8221;
thought Eric.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is crazy!&#8221; thought Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; thought Mr. Van Rasseulger,
&#8220;can he see through the millstone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eric, your good name shall be cleared of
all suspicion. Give me your hand!&#8221; exclaimed
Mr. Lacelle. &#8220;I congratulate you,
lad! I know who did the mischief.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; exclaimed the astonished boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my friend,&#8221; answered the Frenchman,
and darted from the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a go!&#8221; cried Johnny, thrusting
his hands into his pockets and striking an
attitude; &#8220;he knows, and he hasn&#8217;t told us
what he knows, and I think <i>his</i> nose ought
to be pulled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do be still, Johnny,&#8221; said Eric, &#8220;it&#8217;s no
time for jokes. Uncle John, what could he
have meant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am totally in the dark,&#8221; replied his
uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish Froll would come back,&#8221; murmured
Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have it!&#8221; cried Eric, suddenly, rushing
from the room, by the guard at the door,
and after Mr. Lacelle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;I wish I had!&#8221;</p>
<p>Count D&#8217;Orsay&#8217;s conscience was not quite
easy in regard to the manner in which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
had persecuted the two friendless American
boys. His suspicions had been aroused
merely by the fact that they were about to
leave Strasbourg; and the discovery of the
missing articles in their possession had
seemed at the time to prove their guilt conclusively.
But upon reflection, the honest surprise
expressed in little Johnny&#8217;s eyes, and
Eric&#8217;s look of proud, indignant disdain, haunted
him with suggestions of their innocence.</p>
<p>Might it not have been just possible that
they did find the ring upon the floor, and
did not know of the money&#8217;s concealment?
But, then&mdash;how could it be so? How
could the ring and money have happened in
their room, and for what purposes? Yet,
again, if they did intend to steal, they had
given up everything. He had lost nothing;
and the French government would not thank
him for quarrelling with an American just
at that time. He would send word to the
landlord to dismiss the policeman and let the
boys have their liberty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>Just as this conclusion was reached, there
came a tap at the door, and the waiter entered
with Mr. Lacelle&#8217;s card, followed closely
by Mr. Lacelle.</p>
<p>Count D&#8217;Orsay expressed great pleasure
at the unexpected visit; but Mr. Lacelle,
waiving all ceremony, explained that he had
come to clear his dear American friends
from the disgraceful charge against them.</p>
<p>He then spoke rapidly, in French, to the
count, who appeared at first surprised, then
credulous, then convinced.</p>
<p>With sincere regret, he asked to be allowed
to apologize at once, and begged
Mr. Lacelle to tell him of some way in
which he could make some amends for his
unjust accusation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you to be thoroughly convinced,&#8221;
said Mr. Lacelle. &#8220;Place the articles upon
the table, open the window, and conceal
yourself behind the curtain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Lacelle did so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>THE REAL THIEF.</h3>
</div>

<p>Eric, when he reached the hall, was
called by the landlord, who said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am having the rooms searched, at Monsieur
Lacelle&#8217;s request, for your little monkey.
Will you come with me? We may catch her
more easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric was very glad to assist in the search.
When nearly all the front rooms had been
thoroughly examined, to no purpose, the little
truant was found at last in the upper
story asleep, on a soft cushion, in the sunlight.
Eric stole up softly and took possession
of her.</p>
<p>She awoke with a loud chatter of defiance,
and tried to escape, but Eric held her fast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>The landlord then ordered a servant to
close all the windows in the front of the
hotel, excepting those of Count D&#8217;Orsay,
whose room was above that of the two boys.</p>
<p>Eric hastened, at his request, for Froll&#8217;s
collar and chain, which were fastened upon
her, and then she was released upon the
balcony under the window of the boy&#8217;s room,
the landlord, Eric, Johnny, and Mr. Van
Rasseulger watching her movements with intense
interest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the count and Mr. Lacelle
were stationed behind the window curtains, on
the lookout for the marauder.</p>
<p>Presently there was a sliding, scrambling,
shuffling noise, and the thief came in through
the window&mdash;not Eric, nor Johnny, but a
being very insufficiently attired, and possessed
of a long black tail; no less a personage
than the little monkey, Froll.</p>
<p>She walked straight to the table, climbed
upon it, seized the ring, purse, and a gold
pencil which Mr. Lacelle had laid there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
Then she withdrew to the window, but to
her rage and disappointment it was shut
tight, and the two gentlemen confronted her.</p>
<p>The little beast recognized Mr. Lacelle, and
coolly handed him her stolen freight, which
was quickly restored to its rightful owner.</p>
<p>Thoroughly convinced of his unjust cruelty
to Eric and Johnny, Count D&#8217;Orsay descended
to the balcony, offering sincere and earnest
apologies.</p>
<p>Eric and Johnny, by turns hugging and
scolding Froll, freely forgave the indignity
put upon them, and shook hands cordially
with the mortified count.</p>
<p>Mr. Lacelle was in his glory. He shook
hands with the monkey, stroked the boys&#8217;
heads, and called Mr. Van Rasseulger &#8220;my
dear&#8221; in his excitement; telling everybody
how he had instantly surmised the true offender,
on hearing of Froll&#8217;s disappearance,
and recalling the scene at Gravenhaag, when
she had stolen his glasses, climbing in then
through the open window. Finally he expressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
an opinion that Froll had formerly
belonged to an unprincipled master, who had
trained her to climb in at windows and take
away valuables.</p>
<p>And here we will take an opportunity to
remark that this was really the case, and that
Eric subsequently learned that the man of
whom Mr. Nichols bought her was arrested
and imprisoned for practising with another
monkey the same trick.</p>
<p>Count D&#8217;Orsay could not be pacified until
Mr. Van Rasseulger promised that the boys
should visit him at the <i>Hôtel D&#8217;Orsay</i>, on
their return to France.</p>
<p>His conscience smote him for his unjust
severity and unkindness, all the more for the
frank, confiding way in which the two little
heroes begged him to forget the incident.</p>
<p>When they shook hands cordially with him,
a glad cheer ascended from the throng of
servants and spectators, whose honest hearts
took a lively interest in the affair.</p>
<p>The boys and Froll were made much of;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
and Mr. Lacelle delighted Johnny for hours
with accounts of the wonders of the sea, so
that the young gentleman, completely fascinated,
made up his mind to be a submarine
diver when he grew up.</p>
<p>Froll&#8217;s collar was tightened, and she was
fastened to her cage, after having a bountiful
feast of nuts.</p>
<p>When the evening was about half spent, a
waiter brought a large parcel to the door. It
was addressed to &#8220;The Two Young Gentlemen
at Room No. 37,&#8221; and contained books,
toys, games, and confectionery, of which the
count begged their acceptance.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been a day of adventures,&#8221; said
Eric, as he and Johnny were retiring late at
night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Johnny, sleepily, nestling
between the sheets, &#8220;it has been a day
of adventures, beginning with the wonderful
clock, and ending with&mdash;Froll&#8217;s&mdash;Froll&#8217;s&mdash;the
count&mdash;&#8221; and with a little more indistinct
muttering, Johnny was fast asleep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
Eric had read his chapter, and said his prayers
with Johnny; but now, as he looked at
his little cousin asleep, a sudden impulse
seized him, and falling upon his knees by the
bedside, he prayed that his influence over
Johnny might always be for good, and that
God would bless the bright, loving little boy,
and make him a lamb of His fold for the
good Shepherd&#8217;s sake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>PERCY, BEAUTY, AND JACK.</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Van Rasseulger decided to
take the boys to Heidelberg, and there
await Dr. Ward. It was inconvenient for
him to do this, but he was unwilling to let
them travel alone with the monkey again,
for Froll was certainly a serious trouble.</p>
<p>So on the morning of the following day
they took the steamer for an eighty mile sail
down the Rhine.</p>
<p>The landlord, Mr. Lacelle, and Count
D&#8217;Orsay bade them an affectionate adieu, after
the two former had been sincerely thanked
for their kindness to the young strangers,
and the latter had begged them to renew their
promise of a visit before they returned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
America. To Mr. Van Rasseulger he extended
an urgent invitation to visit him, whenever
it should be convenient to him.</p>
<p>Just before they left, Mr. Lacelle requested
Eric&#8217;s address, saying that he had
written to Mr. Montgomery about the box of
money, and would forward his reply to Eric.</p>
<p>The boys were not sorry to leave Strasbourg,
because Mr. Van Rasseulger had told
them he should propose to the doctor to obtain
horses there, and travel on horseback
through the Black Forest, and over the mountains,
to Munich, in Bavaria.</p>
<p>They were enchanted with this idea, and
during their sail down the Rhine lost much
of the beautiful scenery about them in mutual
conjectures as to whether uncle Charlie
would like the proposition. When they
reached Heidelberg, the doctor was already
there, waiting for them.</p>
<p>He was quite well satisfied with the plan,
and said he would give the boys two days to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
explore Heidelberg, and would meantime be
making the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p>The boys did not like Heidelberg particularly,
and Eric&#8217;s shoulders were shrugged expressively
when his uncle told him he was to
be a student in the university, after his school
course was completed.</p>
<p>The only building of which they took any
notice was the Church of the Holy Ghost&mdash;a
large structure with a very high steeple,
divided so that Protestant and Roman Catholic
services were held in it at the same
time.</p>
<p>But perhaps the picturesque old town
might have had more attraction for them,
had not Dr. Ward and Mr. Van Rasseulger
been looking up good horses to purchase for
the journey.</p>
<p>They soon found just what they wanted&mdash;a
large, powerful horse for the doctor, and a
couple of small horses, almost ponies, for the
two boys.</p>
<p>It was amusing to see the different evidences
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
of delight manifested by Eric and
Johnny.</p>
<p>Eric&#8217;s face flushed with glad emotion, and a
quiet &#8220;Uncle John, how good you are!&#8221;
was all that he said.</p>
<p>But Johnny danced around the horses, wild
with delight, throwing his cap in the air,
dancing and hurrahing with all his might,
and bestowing kisses indiscriminately upon
his good papa and the dumb animals.</p>
<p>One of the horses was coal black, with a
white star upon his forehead, and one white
foot; he was for Eric.</p>
<p>Johnny&#8217;s was a bright bay, with four white
feet and a white nose: and the doctor&#8217;s was a
chestnut-colored horse, with a darker mane
and tail.</p>
<p>Of course the first great question was,
what they were to be called.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have named my horse &#8216;Perseus,&#8217;&#8221; said
the doctor, &#8220;in honor of the illustrious slayer
of the Gorgon Medusa, and the deliverer of
Andromeda.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call mine &#8216;Jack,&#8217; in honor of papa,&#8221;
said roguish Johnny.</p>
<p>&#8220;And mine,&#8221; exclaimed Eric, &#8220;shall be
Bucephalus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric had just finished reading a classical
history, and was greatly interested in the account
of Alexander&#8217;s power over Bucephalus.</p>
<p>These names were soon abbreviated to
&#8220;Percy,&#8221; &#8220;Beauty,&#8221; and &#8220;Jack.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the horses had been duly admired,
Mr. Van Rasseulger took the boys with him,
selected saddles, with travellers&#8217; saddle-bags,
rubber cloaks, a couple of blankets, and two
tin boxes for provisions, with an inside compartment
for matches. The rubber cloaks
were made with hoods, which could be drawn
over the head, completely protecting it.</p>
<p>Dr. Ward provided himself with similar
apparel, and numerous little things which the
boys had no idea would be necessary, and
even Mr. Van Rasseulger overlooked.</p>
<p>The next morning everything was in readiness.
The blankets, light overcoats, rubber
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
cloaks, and a change of clothing, were made
into a roll, and strapped behind the saddles.
The tin cases were filled for luncheon, and
deposited in the saddle-bags, and the boys
declared themselves in readiness.</p>
<p>But when the doctor presented them each
with a light knapsack, a tiny compass to
wear upon their watch chains, and a pocket
drinking cup, they instantly discovered that
they could never in the world have got along
without them.</p>
<p>The horses were pawing the ground, impatient
to be off, their long manes and tails
floating in the cool morning breeze, their
noble forms quivering with life and excitement.</p>
<p>Johnny, divided between regret at parting
with his father, and delight at the novel
excursion; Eric, eager and excited, with
mischievous Froll, demure enough just now,
seated composedly upon his shoulder; the
doctor coolly testing the saddle girths, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
Mr. Van Rasseulger seeing them off, happy
in their pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be good and kind to my boy, as you
have always been, Eric,&#8221; he said, bidding
his nephew &#8220;good by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, uncle John, as you have always
been to me,&#8221; Eric replied, with gratitude
beaming in his eyes. &#8220;And Johnny is
a dear little fellow; no one could help being
good to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he will grow like his cousin,&#8221;
said Mr. Van Rasseulger, with a hearty
smile; &#8220;and, Johnny-boy, you must be very
obedient to uncle Charlie. Do right, be a
gentleman, and grow stout and healthy for
papa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will write from Baden and Ulm,&#8221;
said the doctor. &#8220;We ought to get there by
next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a few more words of parting they
set off, and were soon out of sight.</p>
<p>Three hours later, as Mr. Van Rasseulger,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
on his way to Vienna by rail, passed a turn
in the road, the three travellers were in sight
for an instant, apparently in good spirits and
prime condition.</p>
<p>He was extremely pleased with this unexpected
view of them, and for some time after
they had again disappeared the wealthy New
York merchant lay back in his cushioned
seat, building hopes of high promise upon the
future of Johnny&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Poor Johnny! he had been almost spoiled
at home, but under the doctor&#8217;s firm guidance
and Eric&#8217;s good influence, was wonderfully
improved. The bright, merry little fellow
was exhibiting his true character, long hidden
by ill-advised indulgence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>THE LAST.</h3>
</div>

<p>Up the banks of the beautiful Rhine,
through picturesque hamlets, over
high, rugged mountains, and in the glory and
grandeur of the forests, our horseback travellers
sought and found the best of all treasures&mdash;health
and happiness.</p>
<p>The Swabian Mountains, and the Schwarz
Wold, or Black Forest,&mdash;a group of mountains
covered with forests,&mdash;through which
they rode thirty-seven miles, required from
them the greatest endurance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, upon the woody mountains,
steep and difficult to climb as they were,
they found several thriving villages, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
they were kindly received, and where all
their wants were generously supplied.</p>
<p>But on one occasion, when a violent storm
arose, and they were near no village, they
were obliged to take shelter in an empty
barn, and there remained through the night,
sleeping, with their horses, upon the hard,
board floor, with their knapsacks for pillows.</p>
<p>And Johnny had one thrilling adventure.</p>
<p>They had encamped for the night upon
a small plateau, and, before dismounting,
Johnny rode back to the edge, and was looking
down upon the plains beneath, when
suddenly he felt the ground give way from
above where his horse was standing, and in
an instant horse and rider, covered by a bank
of sand, were sliding helplessly down the
mountain. The shower of sand smothered
their cries, and neither the doctor nor Eric
noticed their disappearance at first. But
presently Eric, turning to speak to him, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where in the world is Johnny?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>The doctor looked hastily up. Seeing
the fresh earth at the edge of the plateau,
he rushed to the spot, examined it, and exclaiming,
&#8220;Heavens! the child has fallen
down a slide!&#8221; prepared to descend in the
same place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eric, stay up there, and take care of
the horses,&#8221; he said, and was soon out
of sight.</p>
<p>Eric secured the horses, and then crept to
the place from which the doctor had disappeared.
He found, just beneath him, a long
line of large troughs, open at both ends, and
overlapping each other like shingles. It extended
entirely down the side of the mountain,
and to his horror Eric saw at its foot a
lake.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, Johnny, Johnny! my dear little
cousin! And uncle Charlie, too&mdash;they will
surely be killed!&#8221; he cried, in agony. For
he knew at once that they had gone down
a timber slide, and was afraid they would
be drowned in the lake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>And now I suppose I must tell you
what a timber slide is.</p>
<p>The Black Forest Mountains are covered
with large and valuable trees, which are
felled and sold by their owners; and as it
would be decidedly inconvenient to take
horses and carts up the mountain, and
utterly impossible to get them down with a
heavy load of those giant trees with sound
necks, an ingenious Swiss invented the
cheap and rapid way of getting the trees
off the mountain by means of a slide,
formed of immense troughs lapped together,
and terminating in the lake, where the
heavy logs are chained together and floated
to a railway or wharf, just as they are done
in our own country by the loggers of the
Maine forests and other woody regions.</p>
<p>Of course a descent in one of these
slides, under ordinary circumstances, would
be extremely dangerous to human life and
limb. But it fortunately happened that
neither the doctor, Johnny, nor Jack were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
seriously injured, for the slide had been disused
for some time, and in consequence of
an accident, somewhat similar to Johnny&#8217;s,
had been partially removed, and a high,
soft bank of sand lay at its new terminus.</p>
<p>Johnny and Jack were pitched violently
into this, and rescued from their very uncomfortable
position by a party of English
travellers encamped near by.</p>
<p>Many were the exclamations uttered at
the marvellous and sudden entrance of our
young friend upon the quiet beauties of
the twilight scene, and bewildered Johnny
scarcely knew whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>His first anxiety was for Jack, but the
English gentleman who drew him from the
sand-bank would pay no attention to the
horse until he was convinced that Johnny was
unhurt. Assured about this, he patted and
soothed poor frightened Jack, and walked
him carefully over the soft greensward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
to see if he appeared at all lame; and then
Johnny was delighted enough to hear the
horse pronounced all right.</p>
<p>Johnny had several pretty bad bruises,
which the Englishman, who was a physician,
dressed for him.</p>
<p>By the time this was done Dr. Ward,
whose descent had been much slower and
more careful than Johnny&#8217;s, reached them,
and his anxieties were at once quieted by
Johnny&#8217;s assurance that it was</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the jolliest coast I ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p>After examining both Johnny and Jack,
to assure himself of their well-being, and
heartily thanking the Englishman for his
kind assistance, the doctor asked permission
to leave Johnny under his care until he could
get Eric and the horses from the top of the
mountain.</p>
<p>The new friend willingly undertook the
care of Johnny, and the doctor hastened up
the mountain to relieve Eric&#8217;s anxiety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>Johnny seated himself near the door of
the tent, and a young man of the party
brought him some grapes. Jack neighed
wistfully for his share, for Johnny had made
a great pet of him, always dividing his fruit
with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you some, Jack,&#8221; he said, walking
towards the horse. &#8220;Gracious, how
stiff and sore I feel.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Jack was champing his feast with
great satisfaction, an English boy, of Johnny&#8217;s
size, came towards them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that your horse?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Johnny; &#8220;isn&#8217;t he a good
one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Is</i> he a good one?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he is,&#8221; said Johnny, hotly;
&#8220;there isn&#8217;t a better horse anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But papa&#8217;s groom told me,&#8221; persisted the
English lad, &#8220;that a horse with four white
feet and a white nose was worthless. He
says,&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8216;One white foot, buy him,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Two white feet, try him,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Three white feet, deny him,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Four white feet and a white nose,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Take off his skin and throw him to the crows.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Johnny detected a roguish glitter in his
companion&#8217;s blue eyes, and with a corresponding
twinkle in his own, merely answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;My old nurse says,&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8216;There was an old woman went up in a basket</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Seventy times as high as the moon.&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I suppose you believe that, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>This ready answer pleased the other, and
they were soon fast friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arthur Montgomery,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>Johnny wondered where he had heard
the name before; but though he was sure
he had heard it, he could not remember
where.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>He began to feel quite tired and sleepy
before the doctor returned for him, and his
bruises ached badly. Once he would have
cried and worried every one about him, if in
such an uncomfortable state; but now he
bore the pain like a Spartan.</p>
<p>The doctor came at last, and after thanking
the Englishman again, he led the tired horse,
with weary Johnny upon his back, to a
wood-cutter&#8217;s cottage near at hand, where
they were to pass the night.</p>
<p>Eric welcomed them with tears of joy in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, Johnny, what a narrow escape you
have had!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to be very thankful,&#8221; said the
doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Johnny, sleepily, &#8220;I am
thankful!&#8221;</p>
<p>He woke up just before Eric went to bed,
and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;That boy said his name was Arthur
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
Montgomery. Where have I heard that
name, Eric?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; exclaimed Eric, &#8220;that was the
name on the box of money I found!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew I&#8217;d heard it somewhere,&#8221; murmured
Johnny, dropping off to sleep again.</p>
<p>Eric ran to tell his uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the doctor, quite pleased to be
able to return a good deed, &#8220;we will see
them in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in the morning the English travellers
had disappeared, and our party could find no
trace of them.</p>
<p>Eric was much disappointed. Now he
would be obliged to wait patiently for Mr.
Lacelle&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>Johnny and Jack were not injured by their
descent of the mountain, whose only effects
were some pretty sore bruises, which Johnny
tried not to mind, and an obstinacy in Jack&#8217;s
disposition that no human powers of persuasion
could ever remove. He could never,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
after that memorable slide, be induced to go
near the edge of any kind of an embankment;
and he always declined going aboard
a steamer, until Beauty and Percy had gone
safely over the gangway.</p>
